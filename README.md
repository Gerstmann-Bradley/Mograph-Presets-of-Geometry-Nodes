# Mograph-Presets-of-Geometry-Nodes

This is a github repository of Blender Geometry Nodes Presets made by Bradley Animation (youtu: https://cutt.ly/FUIg4Hb).<br>
This repository is used by the add-on made by Possibly_ferret at https://www.instagram.com/possibly_ferret/.<br>
The add-on Repository is here: https://github.com/Gerstmann-Bradley/Bradley-Geometry-Nodes-Preset <br>
Add-on Download Page: https://gum.co/jSyDM, & Installation Guide: [https://youtu.be/8Xr8kH-6ncE<br>](https://youtu.be/oAmRohCHfxc)

The add-on intends to check updates and download the newest Blender Files from this repository every time you open Blender, and it will link these node groups inside the File. Therefore, you no longer need to check update and download linked file by your own; everything should be downloaded and linked automatically with the add-on.
We hope the add-on will improve your experience in your usages of these presets.<br>

The Manual of these presets are under establishment, it will take a very long time. <br>
Please don't expect it anytime soon. <br>
If you have questions/are willing to contribute to the manual, please contact in the discord server: https://discord.gg/TzuN6sPxQU <br>
