Done:
**Loop For Each Element
-Measurement
-Follow Splines
	-Performance unacceptable. 12ms Vs. 0.32ms
-Array on Curve.
	-likely the same as follow splines.
--Attribute Viewer
	-Obvious Performance Improvement.
-3D Viewer?
	-not needed.

**Loop Index Node
	-Element needs to be based on domain?
		-for 4.3 no longer needed?
-Solver
-Set Branch Radius
-Layered Proximity Falloff
--Cell Fracture
--Curve Interconnection
	-should stay on repeat zone for recursion.
--Fill Curve Tube
	-performance improvement.
--Layered Proximity Falloff?
	-no, not relevant with LFEE.
--Index Offset
--Set branch Radius
	-stay on Repeat zone since layer effecting layers.
--Step Extrusion
--Tree generator
--Measurement
--Tree Wiggle
--Alternating Solver

**Falloff Animation Design.
-Should be in range from 0-1.
	-before 5.0 it's set to 0-2 with soft clamp at 1.
		This is to ensure it's easy to change the value and reset value.
	-from 4.2, reset value can be done directly to default value instead of 0.
		I think the clamp shouldn't be so in the future.
	-change delayed for integrity of many tutorials.
--Proximity Falloff
--Center Falloff
--Mesh Falloff
****************************************************************************************************
To Do:
Investigate the use of Separate geometry by Index

Mirror Modiifer
-the duplicated geo not inheret material?

Dynamic Radius Solver
Dynamic Radius Simulation
-Support Instance just like Relaxation Solver.

Curve Deformer
-Flow% is based on % and sometimes causes a delay because of length difference.
	-add an option to normalize the length.
	-also to consider the effect of start length.

Add: View Transform
-Measure

Reset Self Object Transform.
-What if for normal?
-Is there a better way that can exert everything before?
	-Tree Tilt example.

Add: Fill Cup node?
-when have an top-open cylinder, fill volume inside for liquid.

Sample in Proximity
-Doesn't sounds to be a good design honestly?

Edge of Face
-without Geometry?
-Optimization workflow?

Add: Dynamic Epsilon?
-for epsilon used in large number comparison, such as ID.
	-should be based on how many digits to have?

Attribute Voronoi
-Voronoi on UV surface will result in UV coordinate between (0,0) & (1,1)
	-add a domain to fix it?

Collision on Surface
-New Gravity Implementation
	-add new Bounce Attribute.
		-every collision decreases the energy of bounce and finally stops.
Colliion in Ray
-Backwards Collision Detection Implementation?

Add: Collection to Points?

Add: Cumulative Field
-for float instead of vector in the previous Cumulative Force?
	-a different way of "Trigger" system?

Mesh Rolling
-Support Empty and Vector?

Add: Shader Falloff?

Field to Constant
-Redesign?
-Add Rotation Socket.
	-statistic node doesn't have rotation?
	-what if stay on vector?
-what if using Sample node instead of statistic?
-no longer needed since 4.3?

Collision Deformer
-In Island & Internal Collision, the strength to self should be 0.5.

Curve Connect
-Does Points to Curve improve the algorithm?

Curve Deformer
-Normalize Flow?

UV Deformer
-Unlock Limitation of UV Min/Max?

Trim Curve Normalize / Normalize Curve Length
********************************************************
4.3:
-**Is it still required to work on Instances?
	-Bounding Box falloff.
	-Curve Deformer.
-**a general issue with For each Element is domain + performance.
**Node Default Width.

**Random Transform 4.3
-In case of Hash Value on Seed.
	-Freq works for 0. not sure why?

Add: Serial Accumulate Field?
-instead of group ID in a group.
	-grouping and accumulate sequentially?
----------------------------------
***For 5.0+:
**Vector Rotate into Rotate Vector
-Mesh Rolling
-

Camera Info:
Add: Offset to Camera
	-Needs Camera Info Also though.
Tilt Alignment
-When towards camera, should also consider screenspace so slent tilt for variations.

**Domain Support
-Normalize Field
-Group Per Domain
-3D Viewer
-Remap Vector to Bounds
-Group to Instances

**In case Sample Node into Multiple Linkages:
****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working because they aren't stable relative to geometry?

Tracer
-Dynamic Attribute such as age and falloff will be lost before.
	-This is unavoidable because these attribute are captured upon join.
	-Curve Age is implemented, others requires sample Index.
		-> Implemented.
-If Points are Deleted, tracer will be disrupted.
	-Temporary Sample by ID is implemented.

Temporal Value
-Not Functioning now because for field it requires geometry.
-Too lazy to fix now.

Polygon Unfolding
-has some minor rotation of transform to prevent bug.
-

Float Range
-Only working on Point Domain.

Solidify
-In Instance Mode, Merge by Distance Not Working.

S_Vector Seed
-Currently Seed all Positive Value.
	-Too lazy to build the Switch.

Modulo Falloff
-is based on integer.
	-What if I want to be based on float?

Freeze Geometry
-what if different geometry requiring different status of freeze?
	-switch node can't accept Field.
	-Separate Geometry for Freeze?
		-if the index is changing, what to do?

Set Particle Parameter
-Should Inheret the previous velocity?
	-currently the velocity must be newly written.

Add: Mesh Tangent?
-How to make sure between vertex & face tangent?

Tracer
-I think there are cases you don't want to delete trace when they are deleted?
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Bend Deform
-Angle Check?

Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Add: Recalculate Normal
-Face normal comparing to Vertex & Edge Normal method?
	-Split edge will offset all local information. all normal to be 0,0,1.
	-flipped face normal leads to flipped vertex normal.

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info?
***************************************************************************************************
Still Considering Necessity:
Add: Array Instancer?

Add: Randomize Instance Order?
-Instance on Point + Random Value + Instance Index
-Is this extra nodes really necessary?
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.

Randomness
-Var. means range between full negative Var. & full positive Var.
-Mid-Level Means 2X Positive/Negative.

Check if All index node are using implicit index attribute than ID/Index.
