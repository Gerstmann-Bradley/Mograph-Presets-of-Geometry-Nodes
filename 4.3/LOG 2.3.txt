Done:
**Loop For Each Element
-Measurement
-Follow Splines
	-Performance unacceptable. 12ms Vs. 0.32ms
-Array on Curve.
	-likely the same as follow splines.
--Attribute Viewer
	-Obvious Performance Improvement.
-3D Viewer?
	-not needed.

**Loop Index Node
	-Element needs to be based on domain?
		-for 4.3 no longer needed?
-Solver
-Set Branch Radius
-Layered Proximity Falloff
--Cell Fracture
--Curve Interconnection
	-should stay on repeat zone for recursion.
--Fill Curve Tube
	-performance improvement.
--Layered Proximity Falloff?
	-no, not relevant with LFEE.
--Index Offset
--Set branch Radius
	-stay on Repeat zone since layer effecting layers.
--Step Extrusion
--Tree generator
--Measurement
--Tree Wiggle
--Alternating Solver

**Falloff Animation Design.
-Should be in range from 0-1.
	-before 5.0 it's set to 0-2 with soft clamp at 1.
		This is to ensure it's easy to change the value and reset value.
	-from 4.2, reset value can be done directly to default value instead of 0.
		I think the clamp shouldn't be so in the future.
	-change delayed for integrity of many tutorials.
--Proximity Falloff
--Center Falloff
--Mesh Falloff

Tree Generator
-Seed should be Single value not accepting Field.

Add: Grass Generator

Grass generator
-Every single grass needs its ID for color variations

Bounding Box Falloff
-to be a modifier to output Falloff by Default.

Mirror Modifier
-Mirrored Geometry will have their faces flipped
	-fix by adding flips to every mirror.
	-Investigate: Instances with transform scale -1 will not flip its face.
		-report in #130680

Follow Path Constraint
-Are Curve Extrapolation working?
	-Extrapolation is not limiting the distance, and distance is overriding extrapolation.
	-Removed.
-Fix duplicated object because geometry to instance receiving the original object.
-The extrapolation factor is the exact distance entered. while 0-1 covers length of a curve.
	-fix to make sure relative to the whole curve length.

Random Helices Distribution
-Default Whole Rotation to be 6.28?
	-Randomness Node group has disrupted settings due to menu swtich.
	-the whole rotation settings change to abs mode to make default whole rotation var. 6.28.
		-while whole rotation 0 as default value while available to rotate.

Follow Path Constraints
-should have a input for rotation.

Bounding Box Falloff
-geometry has to be on the top to make modifier version work.
-position without "default attribute" won't be used in the modifier.

Tree Generator
-Resample End is not working.
	-fix
-Resample End method using Map range from min -1. to make sure gradient of resampling.
	-probability end method still using from min 0 instead.

Bevel Curve
-radius should not be overridden with negative value
	-use max 0

Curve Split
-Disable warning of Curve to mesh when input is mesh.
	-not causing error, is bypassed. no need extra nodes?
-simplify to use single capture attribute.

Tree Generator
-Decay Function input do not subtract 1.
	-the decay fuction will now subject to iteration 1 branches.

Tree Generator
-Length End should just be removed.
	-there may be case it may be useful, but generally no and undesired effect?
-Set Length Start?
	-remove trunk Length.
	-Length Start and End use percentage method.
-Why the tip branches sometimes are longer than the main branches?
	-over parameter method is not inhereted across generation.
-Known issue: Noises displacement is displacing branches out of way.
-known issue: need a better interpolation for "over parameter" method.

Add: Interpolate Function
	-for tree generator over parameter method.
	-not yet merged for tree generator due to time and design?

Tree Generator
-inspection index should be removed to 0.

Random Transform
-Add Instance Index; default use "Index".

Is inside volume
-Distance needs to be longer.

Add Curve Branch
-Add ways to input index instead of frames.
	-Remove Seed Over time, add detection if index has its input instead of default.
	-> "Custom Frame"

Radial Instancer
-not working properly in low resolution for rotation.
	-seems related to endpoint fusion issue.
	-> use cyclic curve.

Get UVMap
-should use 2D vector or else it's not recognized by texture coordinate node.

Track to Constraint
-is outputting Instance; should be able to be realized.

Spline Info
-Add Parameter Factor

Add: Erosions

Track to Constraint
-should by default realize 1 depth of instance to recover the original geometry.

radial instancer
-should have options to realize instance

Rod
-Subdivision was not used; a mistake linkage, should be in curve linear?
****************************************************************************************************
To Do:
Investigate the use of Separate geometry by Index

Mirror Modiifer
-the duplicated geo not inheret material?

Dynamic Radius Solver
Dynamic Radius Simulation
-Support Instance just like Relaxation Solver.

Curve Deformer
-Flow% is based on % and sometimes causes a delay because of length difference.
	-add an option to normalize the length.
	-also to consider the effect of start length.

Add: View Transform
-Measure

Reset Self Object Transform.
-What if for normal?
-Is there a better way that can exert everything before?
	-Tree Tilt example.

Add: Fill Cup node?
-when have an top-open cylinder, fill volume inside for liquid.

Sample in Proximity
-Doesn't sounds to be a good design honestly?

Edge of Face
-without Geometry?
-Optimization workflow?

Add: Dynamic Epsilon?
-for epsilon used in large number comparison, such as ID.
	-should be based on how many digits to have?

Attribute Voronoi
-Voronoi on UV surface will result in UV coordinate between (0,0) & (1,1)
	-add a domain to fix it?

Collision on Surface
-New Gravity Implementation
	-add new Bounce Attribute.
		-every collision decreases the energy of bounce and finally stops.
Colliion in Ray
-Backwards Collision Detection Implementation?

Add: Collection to Points?

Add: Cumulative Field
-for float instead of vector in the previous Cumulative Force?
	-a different way of "Trigger" system?

Mesh Rolling
-Support Empty and Vector?

Add: Shader Falloff?

Field to Constant
-Redesign?
-Add Rotation Socket.
	-statistic node doesn't have rotation?
	-what if stay on vector?
-what if using Sample node instead of statistic?
-no longer needed since 4.3?

Collision Deformer
-In Island & Internal Collision, the strength to self should be 0.5.

Curve Connect
-Does Points to Curve improve the algorithm?

Curve Deformer
-Normalize Flow?

UV Deformer
-Unlock Limitation of UV Min/Max?

Trim Curve Normalize / Normalize Curve Length
********************************************************
4.3:
-**Is it still required to work on Instances?
	-Bounding Box falloff.
	-Curve Deformer.
-**a general issue with For each Element is domain + performance.
**Node Default Width.

**Random Transform 4.3
-In case of Hash Value on Seed.
	-Freq works for 0. not sure why?

Add: Serial Accumulate Field?
-instead of group ID in a group.
	-grouping and accumulate sequentially?
----------------------------------
***For 5.0+:
**Vector Rotate into Rotate Vector
-Mesh Rolling
-

Camera Info:
Add: Offset to Camera
	-Needs Camera Info Also though.
Tilt Alignment
-When towards camera, should also consider screenspace so slent tilt for variations.

**Domain Support
-Normalize Field
-Group Per Domain
-3D Viewer
-Remap Vector to Bounds
-Group to Instances

**In case Sample Node into Multiple Linkages:
****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working because they aren't stable relative to geometry?

Tracer
-Dynamic Attribute such as age and falloff will be lost before.
	-This is unavoidable because these attribute are captured upon join.
	-Curve Age is implemented, others requires sample Index.
		-> Implemented.
-If Points are Deleted, tracer will be disrupted.
	-Temporary Sample by ID is implemented.

Temporal Value
-Not Functioning now because for field it requires geometry.
-Too lazy to fix now.

Polygon Unfolding
-has some minor rotation of transform to prevent bug.
-

Float Range
-Only working on Point Domain.

Solidify
-In Instance Mode, Merge by Distance Not Working.

S_Vector Seed
-Currently Seed all Positive Value.
	-Too lazy to build the Switch.

Modulo Falloff
-is based on integer.
	-What if I want to be based on float?

Freeze Geometry
-what if different geometry requiring different status of freeze?
	-switch node can't accept Field.
	-Separate Geometry for Freeze?
		-if the index is changing, what to do?

Set Particle Parameter
-Should Inheret the previous velocity?
	-currently the velocity must be newly written.

Add: Mesh Tangent?
-How to make sure between vertex & face tangent?

Tracer
-I think there are cases you don't want to delete trace when they are deleted?
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Bend Deform
-Angle Check?

Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Add: Recalculate Normal
-Face normal comparing to Vertex & Edge Normal method?
	-Split edge will offset all local information. all normal to be 0,0,1.
	-flipped face normal leads to flipped vertex normal.

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info?
***************************************************************************************************
Still Considering Necessity:
Add: Array Instancer?

Add: Randomize Instance Order?
-Instance on Point + Random Value + Instance Index
-Is this extra nodes really necessary?
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.

Randomness
-Var. means range between full negative Var. & full positive Var.
-Mid-Level Means 2X Positive/Negative.

Check if All index node are using implicit index attribute than ID/Index.
