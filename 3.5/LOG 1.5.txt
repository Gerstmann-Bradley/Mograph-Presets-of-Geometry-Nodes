Done:
Add: Expand/Shrink Selection Node
-should it use value or boolean?
	-difficult to manage value increment/-.

Add: Smooth Position

Add: Tilt Alignment

Fill Volume
-Legacy Behavior.

Tilt Alignment
-Add Tilt Adjustment.

Bounding Box Falloff
-Geometry Output rename to "Instances"?
	-no it's realized, so must not be instances

Remap 0-1
-Should I Clamp the input?
	-When working with Sin Function, not clamping will have a non-clamped correct remapping.

Add: Curve Curvature.

Append Points to Curve
-Resample Method Vs. Extrude Vertices method.
	-stress-testing at 10k random helices distribution with 1k points each.
	-Curve Extrapolation Vs. Append Points to Curve Vs. Extrusion method.
	-492, 466, 624 ms.

Array on Splines
-bug at count 1. shown at parameter 0.
	-why I was using statistic minimum equal method?
	-change to equal to -1 method.

Add: Power Scaling
-for use in 4.0 loop. For every loop, a value should be x% of its previous state. 
	-This is a "function" to multiply the initial value to x% with power of loop index.
-Input:
	Basic Input value; Default 1.
	Base - base of power; such as 80%.
	Loop Index.

Array on Splines
-Sample Curve to output radius.

Loop Index
-Name output as "Loop Index".

Float Range
-Stop Mode not include Endï¼Ÿ
	-When Step= -1, end is not included.

Bounding Box Falloff
-Geometry Output renamed to "Realized Instance"

Fade Falloff
-in Tree Leaves Growth Example, the direction is reversed.
-Can I use Implicite Index, and when needed, to reuse "Group Index" Outside?
	-The issue is not simply the index. but the total number from accumulate field.
-How to reverse Index?

-value/10 is no longer necessary due to value precision; and it caused inconsistency when driving multiple values.
*Fade Falloff
*Follow Splines
-Array on Spline excluded from changes.
	-since offset is unlikely effecting the result?

Oscillation Function
-Actual usage of it?
	-different from sin function, it should be used more for animation than a static scene?

Fill Volume
-Default Value.

Index Extraction
-Still not Functioning on curve?
	-what was the reason statistic point? -deteled

Array on Splines
-Float Range input in Custom Parameter contains error due to Spline Index.
	-If using Points, no Spline index attribute and thus causing errors.
-Rewrite. Using curve instancing on curve to keep spline index attribute?

*Redundancy?
	-Curve Points Preview
	-To Curve Points?
-They are different. Curve Points are Curve resampled at 1. but Curve Points Preview is generating real single points.

Self Random Value
-renamed to "Self Random Seed"

Random Transform
-Output Points instead of Point Instances.

Add: Fibonacci Spiral

Store UVMap
-Add: Offset.

Implicit Attribute
-Add Float Attribute Option.
	-Set negative value to the least.

Add: Local Offset

Add: Trigger
-Boolean Trigger?
-Birth Time Recording?

Add: Curve Intersection Detection

Append Point to Curves
-Add Selection Input. In case position/offset is not changed.

Append Points to Curve
-Default Selection if Offset is 0?
	-find no improvement.
	-Selection method even worse if in extrude mesh method.

Local Offset
-Lock 2nd Axis

Add: Curve Rolling
Delete: Spiral Unfold
****************************************************************************************************
To Do:
Bend Deform
-Angle Check

Index Randomize
-Group Index Bug?

**Falloff - Delete Min/Max options
-to decrease node sizes to allowing more options?
-Remap 0-1 is used more frequently than native min-max.
****************************************************************************************************
To Do:
Bend Deform
-Angle Check

Index Randomize
-Group Index Bug?
****************************************************************************************************
**Serial Loop Node
Add: Index Viewer

Add: Fixed Relaxation Solver
Add: Fixed Intersection Solver

Random Index per island?

Instance Bounding Box
Bounding Box Falloff for Instance?


**Simulation Branch
Start Time, Elapsed Time, Previous Position, Velocity Attribute

Curve Raycast Collision Detection?
Branching Thickness Decrement?

Dynamic Orientation

Follow Spline

**Add: Trigger
-Boolean Trigger?
-Time recording?
****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Multi Switch needed
-Curve Deform
-Directional Falloff
-Radial Falloff
-Group Per Domain
-Follow Splines
-Array on Splines
-Remap Vector by Bounds
-3D Viewer
-Orientation Switch

Add: Origin Offset.
-Too complicate without enum node.

Object Coordinate
-Different Order of Operation is required in different cases.
	-wait for Enum List?/Switch?

Solidify
-Merge by Distance is merging other points too.
	-no way to resolve it.

Index Randomize.
-Group Index? -Failed

Proximity Falloff
-Add Absolute scale Offset?
	-can Change mini of Map range 0.
	-but is adding a new socket necessary?

Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Curve Deformer
-Investigate Necessity of Vector Remap.
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.
