Add: Attribute Viewer

Add: Relaxation Solver
	-Note about Performance improvement about breaking the Loop.
		-Stop evaluation once it's completed.
		-Stop statistics if equal to the last.
Add: Dynamic Radius Solver
Add: Alternating Solver

Rename: Set Branching Parameter
-> Set Branch Parameter

Add: Set Branch Radius

Delete: Inertial Offset

	-Panel For poisson Mode.

Proximity Falloff
-Add: Abs Min/Range Mode.
-Add: Abs Min/Range/Rel.

Add: Layered Proximity Falloff
-layered Evaluation
	-named consideration:
	-Accumulate
	-Layered
	-Composite

Bevel Curve
-Cleanup and Improve UV generation Method.
-Remove Reset Cyclic Option.
-Previous F/L mode was reversed somehow.

Reset Cyclic Spline
-Internal Detection of cyclic status and improve performance.

Backport Bevel Curve and Reset Cyclic Spline changes to 3.6

Simulation Switch
-Internally Replaced by Iteration Switch

Set Particle Parameter
-Should output birthtime/Age?
	-Only birth time can be recorded at birth.
	-Age can be separate output to birth time.

Collision Deformer.
-Add Reverse Detection

Solver
-Add Relative Margin.

Dynamic Radius Solver
-Performance Bug Temp Fix

Add: Collision on Surface.
-Clamp Damping & Friction.

Randomness
-Replace Vector Factor

Proximity Falloff
-Abs/Rel Mode rearrange based on Commonality.
-Falloff Animation rewrite to work for Abs/Rel Mode.
	-Implementation based on distanced value + original version.
	-Pure Distance method will not have upper limit in falloff animation setting.
		-the result will be like "Abs Range" Mode.

Bevel Curve
-Custom UV Parameter?
	-Why not just sample from freeze geometry?

Local Offset
-Fix Offset Z axis malfunction bug.

Dynamic Surface Sampling
-When no Dynamic/Frozen Statement input, use original position.
-When only Custom frozen state input, sampling frozen state.
****************************************************************************************************
To Do:
Array on Splines
-Can custom parameters be captured for later?

Add: Accelerator?
-Set Acceleration and Start Time and output Velocity for Simulation Zone.

Add: Simulation Value
-Customizable Scene Time Frame.

Add: New Geometry Detection

Random Index per island?

Add: Fill Curve Volume?
-Interpolate Curve Method not working.
	-endpoint will be attracted by the guide instead of filling the volume.
-Loop Method.

GN-Known Issue:
Multi Switch needed
-Curve Deform
-Directional Falloff
-Radial Falloff
-Group Per Domain
-Follow Splines
-Array on Splines
-Remap Vector by Bounds
-3D Viewer
-Orientation Switch
-Geometry Type

Add: Origin Offset.
-Too complicate without enum node.

Object Coordinate
-Different Order of Operation is required in different cases.
	-wait for Enum List?/Switch?

Solidify
-Merge by Distance is merging other points too.
	-no way to resolve it.

Index Randomize.
-Group Index? -Failed
-Using Serial Loop

Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Curve Deformer
-Investigate Necessity of Vector Remap.

Bend Deform
-Angle Check?

Capture Velocity
-Is it really working as expected?

Curl Noise Turbulence
-Particle generation Jaggyness investigate.
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.
