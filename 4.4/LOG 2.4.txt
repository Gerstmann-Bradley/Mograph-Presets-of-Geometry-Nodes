Done:
Add: Loft Curve

Add: T_Wrap to Surface from View

Spline Falloff
-Simplify with two falloff animation settings.
	-trim Curve Vs. Falloff Animation.

Proximity Falloff
-add some notations.

Group to Instance
-output separated geometry or some additional sampling?
	-in case there are some more parameters needed.

Loft Curve
Rename: Loft Curves

Loft Curves
-Length Multiplier not respond to actual length.
	-because it was created at the moment of bevel curve.
	-fixed by sampling afterwards.
-Grid method should be faster in most cases than bevel curve method.
	-but bevel curve method useable important for cyclic case.
-a-cyclic curves if cyclic curve combined with a-cyclic curves

T_Wrap to Surface from View
-must not be a modifier.

Follow Spline
-Spline Capture on random scale setting.
	-can be proven with spline index into the scale.
		-the original doesn't work, capture will work.

Curve Linear
-"Value" rename to "Length".

Bounding Box Falloff
-Use Single Value for settings.

Randomness
-In vector case, should to have option to synchronize X and Y scale?
	-differences be done by the scale factor?

Various Socket Settings into single value.

**Remove: Get UV Seam?
-UV seam is an available attribute now.
-decide not remove.
	-the UV seam attribute is reading the seam explicitly set by the user.
		not the ones actually splitting the UV islands.

Curve Extrapolate
-In fan project, the radius is set to 0 during the process.
	-Optimize with single capture attribute.

Loft Curves
-Optimize the transverse connection of curves using spline parameter-index on Points of Curve?
	-also it requires capture attribute due to points to curve transformation.
	-feels unnecessary and chaotic without "connections to curve" addition?
-Add ways to subdivide the amount of curves?
	-Spawn Curves in between and followed by Sort Element to re-order curves?
		-connect between points, resample curve, re-connect between points?
	-how to name two ways of sampling.

Curve Points Preview
-increase node length.

Float Range
-investigate when stop is 0, what's going on?
	-the output will be only dependent on the step value.
		-I added notes and description in case I forgot again.

Loft Curves
-Fill Cyclic Caps.
	-as an approach to replace "fill cup" nodes?
-Add Warning for Fill Cap only if Cyclic Curves.
	-otherwise it will just result in weird geometry appearance.
	-a-cyclic curve also not applicable, because endpoint joins the start point.
-Cap UV based on Bounding Box?
	-Bevel Curve cap has UV range from 0-1.
	-center UV can be done separately.
-Caps only generated on start and end spline.

Inertial Deformer
-Made into Modifier
	-Support Falloff Using attribute.
	-If used as a Modifier, it has to support detecting object mode movement.

Curve Extrapolation
-Support Negative Distance and Factor?
	-Curve Extrapolation is adding new points at the end of a curve.
	-> support negative will mean a 180d turn which is unexpected.
->Not Add; just use trim.

Loft Curves
-When input Instance
	-Points to Curve will run warning of "unsupported type curve"
-> disable points to curve warning.
	-replace with custom warnings.

Inertial Deformer
-Removing External Oscillator.
-Falloff doesn't needs to be sampled

Inertial Deformer
-Factor should allow attribute?
	-yes
-Freq Damp should only allow single value?
	-no?
	-seems interesting in noisy example?

Temporal Object Info
-if it's self object, it has to be Ori Instead of Rel.
	-Add a switch for self object?
-> Use internal switch.
	-when Obj info input as Instance. Only a valid input will be "Instance" count 1
****************************************************************************************************
To Do:
Add: Connections to Curve?
-Points to Curves requires point.
	-it requires curve to points and mesh to points accordinly.
-how to capture attribute?
	-what if using spline parameter for such index?

Temporal Object info
-it's only reading the location, without rotation and scale.
-should get an geometry velocity too?

Add: Posterize Time
-as an additional function from Freeze Geometry?
	-why don't I just do it in AE?

T_Wrap to Surface from View
-in case of orthographic view.
-In case modes other than using view?

Snap to Surface
-advanced mode for geometry instead of?
	-As instance? Vs. As Geometry
		-> Snap to Surface Vs. Wrap to Surface?

Tree Generator
-In serial, needs to update hierarchy number?
-Resample should work on the custom curve?

Curve Deformer
-Flow% is based on % and sometimes causes a delay because of length difference.
	-add an option to normalize the length.
	-also to consider the effect of start length.

Reset Self Object Transform.
-What if for normal?
-Is there a better way that can exert everything before?
	-Tree Tilt example.

Sample in Proximity
-Doesn't sounds to be a good design honestly?
	-Vector Mixing is a nightmare.
	-it should always be Color that indicates the end product from the Coordinate.

Collision on Surface
-New Gravity Implementation
	-add new Bounce Attribute.
		-every collision decreases the energy of bounce and finally stops.

Add: Cumulative Float
-for float instead of vector in the previous Cumulative Force?
	-a different way of "Trigger" system?

Collision Deformer
-In Island & Internal Collision, the strength to self should be 0.5.

Trim Curve Normalize / Normalize Curve Length
********************************************************
4.5:
set mesh normal node: pulls/132583
-Add: Mix Normal in Proximity

Curve to Mesh: now on it's using "Scale".
-the radius no longer effects the thickness.
	-versioning is using the radius to prevent breaking tutorials.
-when to break the old tutorial? how to set it up?
	-> not to break the tutorial; still using the radius.
-> change from practice, the Scale should now accept a field; multiplied by radius.

Remove Named Attribute from Curve to Mesh Change
-Helical Connections
-

Boolean Toggle of Panel.
-Loft Curves
	-Advanced Options for Caps.
		-grid subdivsion for caps?
	-index output?

*Scene Info.
-improve Animate interpolation?
	-but curves are not possible.

*Camera Info
-Is Inside View can be more automatic.

Loft Curves
-Guide Resampling rename -> Guide Count
-Cross Resampling rename -> Cross Count

----------------------------------
5.0+: Dynamic Socket Vsibility
-Point Distribute
-Attribute Voronoi

****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Tree Generator
-Noises displacement is displacing branches out of way.
-need a better interpolation for "over parameter" method.

Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working because they aren't stable relative to geometry?

Tracer
-Dynamic Attribute such as age and falloff will be lost before.
	-This is unavoidable because these attribute are captured upon join.
	-Curve Age is implemented, others requires sample Index.
		-> Implemented.
-If Points are Deleted, tracer will be disrupted.
	-Temporary Sample by ID is implemented.

Temporal Value
-Not Functioning now because for field it requires geometry.
-Too lazy to fix now.

Polygon Unfolding
-has some minor rotation of transform to prevent bug.
-

Float Range
-Only working on Point Domain.

Solidify
-In Instance Mode, Merge by Distance Not Working.

S_Vector Seed
-Currently Seed all Positive Value.
	-Too lazy to build the Switch.

Modulo Falloff
-is based on integer.
	-What if I want to be based on float?

Freeze Geometry
-what if different geometry requiring different status of freeze?
	-switch node can't accept Field.
	-Separate Geometry for Freeze?
		-if the index is changing, what to do?

Set Particle Parameter
-Should Inheret the previous velocity?
	-currently the velocity must be newly written.

Add: Mesh Tangent?
-How to make sure between vertex & face tangent?

Tracer
-I think there are cases you don't want to delete trace when they are deleted?
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Bend Deform
-Angle Check?

Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Add: Recalculate Normal
-Face normal comparing to Vertex & Edge Normal method?
	-Split edge will offset all local information. all normal to be 0,0,1.
	-flipped face normal leads to flipped vertex normal.

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info?

Bevel Curve
-Why Bevel Curve requires additional Set material node?
	-because of Mesh to Curve Node will cause lose of materials.

Investigate the use of Separate geometry by Index

Investigate Curve Rolling
***************************************************************************************************
Still Considering Necessity:
Add: Array Instancer?

Add: Randomize Instance Order?
-Instance on Point + Random Value + Instance Index
-Is this extra nodes really necessary?
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.

Randomness
-Var. means range between full negative Var. & full positive Var.
-Mid-Level Means 2X Positive/Negative.

Check if All index node are using implicit index attribute than ID/Index.
