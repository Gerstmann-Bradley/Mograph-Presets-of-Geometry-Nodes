Done:
Add: Loft Curve

Add: T_Wrap to Surface
****************************************************************************************************
To Do:
Randomness
-In vector case, should to have option to synchronize X and Y scale?

Add: Tool_Snap to object surface based on view transform?
-for GP drawing like?

Snap to Surface
-advanced mode for geometry instead of?
	-As instance? Vs. As Geometry
		-> Snap to Surface Vs. Wrap to Surface?

Spline Falloff
-Should I prepare two Falloff Animation Settings?

Tree Generator
-In serial, needs to update hierarchy number?
-Resample should work on the custom curve?

Curve Deformer
-Flow% is based on % and sometimes causes a delay because of length difference.
	-add an option to normalize the length.
	-also to consider the effect of start length.

Reset Self Object Transform.
-What if for normal?
-Is there a better way that can exert everything before?
	-Tree Tilt example.

Sample in Proximity
-Doesn't sounds to be a good design honestly?

Add: Dynamic Epsilon?
-for epsilon used in large number comparison, such as ID.
	-should be based on how many digits to have?

Collision on Surface
-New Gravity Implementation
	-add new Bounce Attribute.
		-every collision decreases the energy of bounce and finally stops.

Add: Cumulative Field
-for float instead of vector in the previous Cumulative Force?
	-a different way of "Trigger" system?

Collision Deformer
-In Island & Internal Collision, the strength to self should be 0.5.

Trim Curve Normalize / Normalize Curve Length
********************************************************
4.5:
----------------------------------

****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Tree Generator
-Noises displacement is displacing branches out of way.
-need a better interpolation for "over parameter" method.

Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working because they aren't stable relative to geometry?

Tracer
-Dynamic Attribute such as age and falloff will be lost before.
	-This is unavoidable because these attribute are captured upon join.
	-Curve Age is implemented, others requires sample Index.
		-> Implemented.
-If Points are Deleted, tracer will be disrupted.
	-Temporary Sample by ID is implemented.

Temporal Value
-Not Functioning now because for field it requires geometry.
-Too lazy to fix now.

Polygon Unfolding
-has some minor rotation of transform to prevent bug.
-

Float Range
-Only working on Point Domain.

Solidify
-In Instance Mode, Merge by Distance Not Working.

S_Vector Seed
-Currently Seed all Positive Value.
	-Too lazy to build the Switch.

Modulo Falloff
-is based on integer.
	-What if I want to be based on float?

Freeze Geometry
-what if different geometry requiring different status of freeze?
	-switch node can't accept Field.
	-Separate Geometry for Freeze?
		-if the index is changing, what to do?

Set Particle Parameter
-Should Inheret the previous velocity?
	-currently the velocity must be newly written.

Add: Mesh Tangent?
-How to make sure between vertex & face tangent?

Tracer
-I think there are cases you don't want to delete trace when they are deleted?
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Bend Deform
-Angle Check?

Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Add: Recalculate Normal
-Face normal comparing to Vertex & Edge Normal method?
	-Split edge will offset all local information. all normal to be 0,0,1.
	-flipped face normal leads to flipped vertex normal.

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info?

Bevel Curve
-Why Bevel Curve requires additional Set material node?
	-because of Mesh to Curve Node will cause lose of materials.

Investigate the use of Separate geometry by Index

Investigate Curve Rolling
***************************************************************************************************
Still Considering Necessity:
Add: Array Instancer?

Add: Randomize Instance Order?
-Instance on Point + Random Value + Instance Index
-Is this extra nodes really necessary?
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.

Randomness
-Var. means range between full negative Var. & full positive Var.
-Mid-Level Means 2X Positive/Negative.

Check if All index node are using implicit index attribute than ID/Index.
