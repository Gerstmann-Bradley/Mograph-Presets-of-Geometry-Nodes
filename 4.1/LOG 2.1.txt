Follow Splines
-Fix Loop Start & Loop Minimum
	--keep in case of motion variances.

Delay Falloff
-Discard Enum plans.
	-Loop Factor into Float for more general effect.
-Add Advanced Panel

Delete Orientation Switch
-only used once inside a node group.

Delete: Object Coordinates
-Previous Known Issue: Different Order of Operation is required in different cases.
	-wait for Enum List?/Switch?

Bevel Curve
-Allow Scaling of Cap UV automatically.
-New Sections for Fills Caps.
	-allowing spherical.
	-allowing parameter for UV scales.

Braid
-Amp & Rel Factor/100 into %.

Add: Origin Offset.
-currently only support Bottom Center.
-not making sense for working on instances.
	-realizing instances will be performance heavy.

Face Points
-UV X and Y.
	-not mixing because I don't want diagnal value come into play?

UV Transfer -> Get UVMap
-"UVMap" for consistency than "UV Map"

Solidify
-Improve performance by limiting merge by distance to boundary.

Noise 3D, Vector Noise, Voronoi 3D
-allow more dimensions.

Bevel Curve
-Fix: somehow I disabled merge by distance.
-If Input Curve is cyclic, Fill caps Function should be disabled regardless.
-Caps Segments first to show importance.
-Allow Caps of Custom Bevel
	-Segment only for 1 because limitation in Fill Curves.
	-UV Unwrap possible.
	-Use flipping face instead of rotation since bevel shape may irregular.
		-Flipping face is not good for spherical rotation case.
		-enable flipping face only for custom bevel.
-Delete Curve when length 0.
	-Performance test seems not to be impacted by presence of delete geometry.
-Rename to "Round Cap"

Motion Variance
-Fix Randomness inside.

Add: Rotate Euler
-for the moment Feb.2.2024 until Rotate Rotation Support Local Axis.
-If all in 1 axis, performance the same.
	-but if random axes, rotate rotation in sequence faster than single rotate euler.

Reset Spline Cyclic
-Rewrite with Extrude?
	-no. Errors and performance either minimally better or worse.

Bounding Box Falloff
-Clean up.
-not implementing Center Mode
	-needs to add a new socket of expansion.
	-not sure if it's worth so to take extra space.
	-also too complicate when working with instances.

Delete: Object Control
-Doesn't seem necessary and less used overall.

Directional Falloff
-Use Rotate Vector to replace Vector Rotate.
	-Origin issue done by subtract and add back the location offset.

****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Solidify
-Merge by Distance is merging other points too.
	-no way to resolve it.

Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working because they aren't stable relative to geometry.
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Curve Deformer
-Investigate Necessity of Vector Remap.

Bend Deform
-Angle Check?

Capture Velocity
-Is it really working as expected?

Curl Noise Turbulence
-Particle generation Jaggyness investigate.
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.
