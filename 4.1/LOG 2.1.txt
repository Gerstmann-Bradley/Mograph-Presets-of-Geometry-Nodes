Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working because they aren't stable relative to geometry?

Tracer
-Dynamic Attribute such as age and falloff will be lost before.

Curve Deformer
-Investigate Necessity of Vector Remap.
	-solved: to make sure correct offset along curve, bounding box is required.

Record Velocity
-Is it really working as expected?
	-solved: many examples such as align rotation to velocity proves.

Instance Bounding Box
-known using local axis.
	-Split to Instances can reset axis to global.
		-the question is what group ID to use. what's the common use case?
-solved by adding global axis now.

Bend Deform
-Angle Check?

Curl Noise Turbulence
-Particle generation Jaggyness investigate?
	-solved: possibly related to float point precision of Seed?


Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Add: Recalculate Normal
-Face normal comparing to Vertex & Edge Normal method?
	-Split edge will offset all local information. all normal to be 0,0,1.
	-flipped face normal leads to flipped vertex normal.
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.

Randomness
-Var. means range between full negative Var. & full positive Var.
-Mid-Level Means 2X Positive/Negative.

Check if All index node are using implicit index attribute than ID/Index.
