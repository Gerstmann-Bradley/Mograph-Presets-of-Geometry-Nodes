Done:
**Decimal Shift default value
	-some default is currently set to 0 in 4.5 for versioning old files.
-Float Range.
	-1
-Curve Linear
	-1
	-need set curve radius at 0.005?
		-but reason it effect bevel curve because of radius support.
-Bevel Curve
	-1
-Helical Connections
	-1
-Sin Function
	-1

**G_Hash Seed
-a better method can be used, but should only be done in 5.0 because of breaking changes.
	-then it will break with Seed change in 5.0

Mirror Modifier
-add Info-warning when bisecting instance, because it shouldn't work anyway.
	-this is a tricky question, because it is actually bisecting.
		-just not accessing the internal structure.
-auto-hide not working on Custom Vs. Self Origin.
	-it's not working, likely due to bad closure inference issues/144870

**Closure and Bundles
	-remove duplication of code
--Mirror Modifier
--Sin Function
	-can remove Sin Unit.

Warning review
--proximity falloff
	-warning
--animate
	-warning
--face points
	-warning
--deprecation warning
	-should be info but keeping as warning.
--bevel Curve
	-interesting example to show what should be info & warning each.
--smooth position
	-good example of info.

*Value Precision.
-remove "on delta time".
	-questionable, since it's an approximation now, better to keep it.
	-because scene info node is not down anyway.

**Remove Trash Code
--UV Deformer
	-but bounding box code from 3.5, because radius was effecting BBox.
--Mirror Modifier

Deprecation:
--Array on Splines
	-Array on Curves
--Alignment on Splines
	-align rotation on Curves
--Follow Splines
	-Follow Curves
--ZC_10b_attribute viewer performance test
-Points Distribute
	--Face Area code

Reset Curve Cyclic
-completely rewrite with Trim Curve at 0.9999.
	-it will break the cyclicity but keep everything working.
	-also extremely fast.

Curve Extrapolation
-Should provide options to break cyclic or not.
-Add Selection
-Distance output will no be field on each point instead of statistic.
	-use signed distance.

Attribute Viewer
-View Value must be set to dynamic instead of Auto. seems a bug somewhere.

Curve Extrapolation
-fix disruption of original curve normal.

3D viewer
-if no implicit input, it should output instances.

Curve Extrapolation
-add options to prevent cyclic curve breakage.
-add options for distance relative to length
-need to test index swap.
	-Mesh to Curve will Swap Index.

**Curve Deformer
	-better to rewrite with closure to remove repetition.
-Clean up for better design?
	-how was instance mode determined?
	-if Extrapolation can be done in path constraint, why not in deformer?
-method: Relative/Normalized Mapping Vs. Absolute World Mapping.
	-the existing workflow are based on relative.
-need to have an output to preview curve.
-integrated Curve Extrapolation.
	-worked, although can't be bypassed because of "Curve to Mesh"
-Mode: Single Vs. Instances
	-Single must be normalized to scale?
	-Instances may be normalized to scale or not?
-> it's found there's a point where for each element becomes more efficient.
	-more complex the output geometry, more efficient it will be.
		-about 168 Vs. 393 ms on 40,40,40 cubes at 2000 count.
		-about 22 Vs. 3.2 ms on 2,2,2 cubes at 2000 count.
	-Regular Suzanne at 2000 count, 32 Vs. 26 ms.
		-subsurf 1, 78 Vs. 93 ms
		-subsurf 2, 133 Vs. 318 ms
-> Single Vs. Instances Mode is not needed.
	-it can be directly put into a for each element even for single curve.
		-minimal performance impact.
-Curve Extrapola can't be bypassed internally for cyclic curve.
	-somehow there's a bug in Flow, tried to solve bu no success.
		-anyway it's not required to solve.
	-For each element can bypass it more directly using Geo Switch.
-> However in actual integration these tanks miserably.
	-even just use "Loop Index" will be deadly. looking for answer at issues/144972
-Single Vs. Instances Mode.
	-Single Mode may not be necessary.
	-in 500,500,500 Cube, Single Vs. Instance doesn't differ much.
		-10 Vs. 20 ms; not effected by the curve resolution.
-> Single can be merged into Instances mode.
-Duplicate Vs. Select per Curve
	-Duplica per Curve is automated as previous Instance mode.
	-what about Select per curve?
		-what automation is expected? Per Island? NO.
		-Pick Instance?
			-use the same geometry input for convenience.
			-but need to add warnings.
-> into "Pick Instance".
	-it has its warning too.
--Different Flow
	-it confuses me a lot, but basically only info read by Mesh needs Sampling.
		-the captured Instance Index means 0 if the value is only read by Curve.
--Different Scalings
-Offset Flow is no longer needed? because anyway extrapola is integrated inside.
	-can keep it since it doesn't hurt and properly documented.
-Sampling in Closure may be a bad idea.
	-In case more samplings are required?
	-2 types of Sampling in general.
		-1 can sample outside for each whole curve, need to output an Index
		-2 can sample along curve, can only be done inside.
-Absolute Mode Implementation:
	-should completely bypass the need of Bounding Box & Remap?
		-> No offset panel is needed, because it's done fully on the original axis.
	-world origin 0 is the perfect starting point.
		-distance on the selected x will cover the length of curve.
	-> it relys on the bounding box, just no Normalize and Remap Process.
-In relative mode, geometry is mapped within the range from -1 to +1.
	-> extrapolation was controlled by the "Offset" subject to this region.
-> In absolute mode, no virtual Offset is available.
	-has to sample info from the Mesh.
-Abs mode: can't figure out how to offset BBox & final position separately.
	-it's easier to offset instance as a whole.
	-to simplify the process, sample & capture at the most beginning.
-for some reason, Abs mode has flipped normal on Y & Z and will clip on axis.
	-requires negati in some binormal to work.
-Add Instances Warning if Pick Instance is not on.
-Proportional Scale toggle in Pick Instance.
	-scale different instances based on the largest instances
		-to keep relative scale of them. need attribute statistic?
	-which axis to chose, or based on diagonal?
		-based on forwarding axis.
	-should be disabled in Abs mode.
-Abs Pick bug when using random flow.
	-sampling from Geo to Curve has issue because index doesn't match.
		-solution Ref from Group to Instances.
-Abs Cyclic based on the Max Length of Curve.
-Performance test on 40,40,40 Cube at 2000 Count.
	-274 Vs. 360 ms
	-no significant differences found between modes.
		-Abs mode may fast as 200

Curve Deformer
--Abs mode has a bug in Single Curve
	-forgot to enable back the offset Min bounding box.
--Relative Mode has completely broken Cyclic Curve
	-fulled fixed with proper Sampling max Length on Spline Domain.
--Abs mode on multiple cyclic seems to have bug.
	-also only go positive and no negative.
	-because when it's cyclic, it doesn't neeed offset.
--When the targeted X contains 0, Proportionl scale can be broken.
	-set math maximum at a small value.
		-although it can still result in extreme case, will leave it now.

Scale Selection
-clean up with Closure.

Add: S_Gabor Flow
Add: S_Edge Gradient

Solidify
-was not outputting curves.
	-because of separate component.
	-for the moment curve to mesh automatically.

**Bend Deformer
	-rewrite
--Confirm of original modifier behavior.
	-only work on XY-plane, Z-axis geometry.
		-whole X/Y fold on X/Y Axis.
		-Z-axis, only XZ plane folded on two sides. YZ stays.
--Origin Offset has relevant and irrelevant part.
	-needs to be selected for each mode.
-want to add ability masking the effect.
	-right now offset the origin will bump the other side as well.
	-Origin Offset and such threshold is essentially the same magnitude?
		-it should still work for all types more than just curves
-> the current method is a sharp transition.
	-smooth transition is not possible because it works on the entire geometry.
	-so input will be rather a toggle?
--why XY-Z working for XY test mesh, but not for YZ test mesh?
	-XY test Mesh is moved on X, but YZ test mesh hasn't been moved.
		-so their gradient has been drawn differently.
	-> needs to capture the mixed bounds after movement.
x-give up on flipping the direction while keeping the same offset for the same effect.
	-maybe technically easy, but it may take too many switches for different offset
--support Rotation Value always relative to the bounding box length on axis.
	-for 4m length line, angle pi/2 is enough for a full circle.
		-the multiplication makes it enough for 2 pi circle.
--support Rotate the axis of bending.
	-need 3rd set of axis which influence bend only if axis rotated.
	-currently using "Rotating instance after offset to origin" method.
		-a bit simpler than rotating position on 2 stages separately.
->it has issue if clampping + rotating more than 90 degree.
	-map range requires a larger gradient for smoother transition.
		-but it also makes the result dramatically different from normal state.
	-overall I think it's fine now.
--need to add a viewer system to indicate location and orientation of bending.
	-viewer axis is tricky, but finally decided to use plane-CP-axis
	-multi-viewer markers are confirmed.
	-known issue: viewer marker is done by GP.
		-1. it has to be rendered by GP.
		-2. attribute overlay must be on to give it color.
x-support object absolute offset.
	-no plan for the moment.
	-it should be easy to do, but seem far less productive compared to procedural offset & rot.

**UV Deformer
-add options for Custom Bounding Box?
	-Bounding box have input & output.
-> input can be Vector & Geometry.
-> output can be ???
	-default from 0-1 & -/+Z.
	x-mapped dimension seems barely used?
-Decimal Shift value back to 0. Z-axis recovery should be correct now?
	-may even remove decimal shift, but will keep for now.

Curve Split
-it only output curves, input other geometry are ignored.
	-should have warnings

Sin Function
	-fix issue from decimal shift
--Knit Unit
--Knit Surface
--Braid
--Tree Generator
--Woven Surface

Proximity Falloff
-using new

Helical Connections
-4.5.2 solves the bug. no need to capture tilt anymore.

Hair on Geometry
-integrate Hair on Surface into.
	-should also support both Mesh & Curve?
	-Surface Cling mode
-use new bend deformer.

Woven Surface
-needs spline index on each axis

Curve Deformer
-why sampling Spline Parameter not working?
	-seems working as intended.

default value when sampling on color
	-should make sure black start.
--curve deformer
--array on curves
	-fine already.
--Follow Curves
	-float to color

UV Deformer
-what about capture the vector map value trying to save performance?
	-not improving any performance.
		-also not seem to change any result.
	-will leave it there.

Bevel Curve
-Free Profile has resolution dependency.
	-known bug upstream in Blender.
	-/issues/145103
		-closed

Hair on Geometry
-better to re-arrange some layout.
	-radius better exposed.
	-default value of XY-rot

UV Deformer
-in custom bounding box mapping, if geometry is outside, it will be clamped to be included.
	-> it must be in the targeted UVMap area and deletion is not working.
-> remove clamping of Vector map range so it can extend outside.

Fill Curve Tube
-inner Ring tob a factor of outer ring.
-add evenness setting

Fill Curve Tube
-different count in different rings?
	-it's already doing it
x-radius mode to set count based on radius?
	-tried but didn't work well.

Bend Deformer
-due to split instance, the attribute didn't propagate well.
	-need to sample & captured at Instance before realization.
-> I wonder how many boolean options are needed.
	-currently clamp tob single value, but flip direction is field.

Bend Deformer
x-investigate possibility to shrink the endpoint
	-a multiplier after (1-Angle) can shrink.
		but generally not working well.
		-also how to setup gradient?

Curve Deformer
x-the scale will disrupt the normal rule of flow from 0-1.
	-should a factor be added to resolve it?
-> flow dividing scale seems not to work in this case.
	-I'm also not convinced the benefit of it.
-> in fact, since it's mapped, then no matter the scale.
	flow 0-1 to across the whole length of curve in relative.
	-in absolute it doesn't work because geometry may not be centered on world origin.
		-so it can never be guaranteed.

Add: Set Curve Radius
-only goal is to add decimal shift.

Dynamic Surface Sampling
-simplify.
-add warning
-update test

Hair on Geometry
-add tangent mode for rotation

Random Rotation
x-worth to make Z-only into a menu switch?
	-so that extra XY can be hidden in non-Zonly mode?
-> I think Extra XY is always useful.

Helical Connections
-set curve radius at the end to keep original curve radius.
	-important for hair on geoemtry.

Hair on Geometry
-Surface options all into panel
-improve falloff setup

Curve Split
-automatic set curve radius

Proximity Falloff
x-2nd Scale Offset input?
	-better not, as for better instruction.

**Sin Function
-remap 0-1 is having conflict to Amp*0.1.
	-make a new menu and parameter for modes?
-> why insertion fails?
	-because geometry output is considered.
		-for now a known limitation in blender.

Curve Deformer
-absolute seems respond to deformation but why?
	-it contains bounding box of the original geometry.
	-it's used as kind of statistics?
-> the issue is in the min-bounds used to offset flow?
	-it was always using X instead of XYZ accordingly.

Add: S_Point Light BG

Temporal Smooth position
-initialize mixing by 0 since no input at beginning?
	-> into a panel with panel toggle.

hair on geometry
-surface cling not working if noise displacem is disabled.
	-because they share the same selection on set position


Woven Surface
-automatic resolution incremmeshent?
x-why is edge prominent?
	-because of smooth position.

automatic resolution increment
-Knit Surface

Index Reverse
-when inputting curve, will have unsupported type mesh...
	-in fact it's completely broken
-> how to resolve it?
	-sort element supports spline, check how it looks first.
-> fixed, but seems to have inherited problem.

Curve Deformer
-add noramlzie flow rate based on the curve length.

Hair on Geometry
-when both deforming & surface cling, end tip should snap better.
	-cv the group is getting complicate.
	-may need rewrite for better design?

Knit Surface
-Mode A support output instances

Hair on Geometry
-problematic to have a single falloff to control both length & Radius.
	-in case like surface cling, falloff on length will disrupt target.
-> in fact why falloff on length? it's not visible if radius 0.

Sin Function
-output Cos so that constant phase can be left clean.

Curve Falloff
-Resample into a Panel
-can size of proximity may accept field of a curve.
-all input support field now

Merge Distance Curve
-output into expanded menu.

Add: View Angle Transparency
x-layer weight facing already finishes it.
	-would better to wait for color ramp in node group to solve issue.

Add: Offset towards Camera
-directly working on position will scale down geometry ntl it flips normal.
	-working on offset in current way seems to be perfect

Edge Gradient
-including color ramp inside is really a bad idea.

S_Center UV
-add a scale option

Offset towards Camera
-add decimal shift

Add: S_Separate RGB

Align Rotation to Camera
-expose position to allow single value

Add: S_Polar Coordinate
-use closure to resolve texture issues.

Add: Wave Propagation
-single Wave Vs. multiple wave?
	-right now single wave only.
-in multiple wave, clamp front?

Following Curves
-output parameter
-sampling into panel

S_Vector Noise
-add implicit vector as UV

Dot Product Falloff
-Falloff Normalized to 0-1
-Crude Dot Product output separately.

Add: Store Attribute

**Bend Deformer
	-2nd rewrite
-Mode. Single Vs. Instance

3D viewer
-outputting Point when no Geo input, should also rotated by input.

Add: S_Radial Falloff

Add: S_Flowery Mask

**Translate position
-becomes relative offset
	-relative offset seems more constant to have a consistent speed.

Add: S_Translate position
-for simpler connection than the regular multiple vector math.

Wave Propagate
-forgot color ramp 0-1-0.

Offset towards Camera
-needs to be a modifier
-use % factor; slide by holding shift.

S_proximity falloff
-implicit coordinate
-add value precision

Polar Coordinate
-a more formal testing node tree.

Add: S_Dissipation
-still many issues in design, but will keep for now.

Bend Deformer
-single XY-Y, XZ, ZY all broken?
-Viewer XY-Y broken in single?
-> important to know how XZ-Y is meant to work.
	-all plane Axis-Z intended to be a middle ground?
		-> no, not intuitive to know the actual axis.
-> fixed for all axis now.

Radial Instancer
-fix plane rotation on 2

Origin Offset
-into a node tool

Polar Coordinate
-advanced options are useless and can cause issue.

Add: S_Venetian Blinds
Add: S_Tiling

Add: S_Tiling Converge
-not yet made into an asset because unsure about practical workflow yet.

Negati
-add average setting

Bend Deformer
-add default angle value so it becomes more obvious about it's intended effect?

S_center falloff
-Z no need to be centered

S_Normal Displacem
-implicit coordinate

Point Light BG
-implicit coordinate.

Smooth position
-if only contains edges, it has been converted to a curve internally.
	-for the purpose of weight on start & end?
-> but i forgot to convert it back.

Align Rotation to Points
-investiga rela btw point & normal.
	-thought I defined them wrongly.
-> normal was used for point on attraction / repulsion.
	-it's not used as 2` axis.
-> add additional 2` axis control, expose axis too.

Tracer
-add resampling option, to reduce total amount of points if possible.

**Grid Nodes
--Points Distribute to allow Grid.

Points Distribute
-fix Grid node warning
-socket re-ordering

Add: Sync Grid Transform
-Grid Transform + Grid info

Add: SDF Smooth

**Node Output Visibility
	-it still relys on menu, even though it seems working for all boolean.
--Bounding Box Falloff
	-currently Bounding Box falloff still is modifier. so geometry output is kept.
	-but separate them into 2, and keep realized instance...
-Sin Funciton
-Decay Function?
-Reset Local Transform
	-the geometry & field can be separated into each mode.
--Match Size
	-right now the output is in face corner domain.
		-the domain is set by interface and not exposed for changes.
	-> best to have 2 outputs and swapped by conditions.
--Curve Deformer
	-Instance Index should be exposed. it's good for sampling.
	-need to rewrite mode for Single Vs. Instances?
	-> was done before.
--Bevel Curve
	-should add an "Are Caps" option.
		-but need to hide in flat mode because no fill caps in flat.
x-Radial Array
	-fibonacci mode has its falloff output.
	-right now it's a boolean, but perhaps better as a mode?
--Negati
	-support vector; also need to support dif axis?
	-but will need to be able to hide sockets.
-Modulo Falloff
	-Support Float & Integer with menu?
--Point Distribute
	-normal & rotation should only be available for faces mode.

**Optional Label
	-should be done to all object input
--proximity falloff
--direcitonal falloff
--radial falloff
--Center Falloff
--Mesh Falloff
--Hair on Geometry
--Parenting

Add: SDF offset

Add: to Volume Grid

Edge Damage
-method A & B.
-as old method better but less reliable.
	-Vs. new method more reliable but seems dumb.
-> not sure if this is really good to have this modifier.

Resistance Force
-the logic seems that a resistance force is accumulated and Vel keeps subtracted.
	-issue: Vel will ultimately be 0.
	-not possible to clamp Vel because requires to know the initial Vel?
		-or what if I set a Ress higher than Vel?
-> Add Min Force

Add: Volume Grid Output?
-either store named Grid or Grid to Mesh

Time Falloff
-add time Vs. Birth Time

Voxel Remesh
-rewrite using Grid
-seems to be faster

Planar Remesh
-using new Voxel Remesh

Text Mesh
-using new Voxel Remesh

Curve Linear
-count rename to "Resolution"
-output shouldn't be "Curves"

index mask falloff
modulo falloff
-should use floored modulo for negative region

curve resampling
-point preview should be advanced.

Bend Deformer
-requires reset scale & rotation in global
-but this is very rare in actual set instance scale & set instance rotation

Bevel Curve
-remove curve at no length is failing when filling cap.

Add: Simple Blind

radial array
-fix to enable count 2

Add: Random per Island

Follow Path Constraint
-curve preview
-advanced option for flip start & end.
-scale factor for geometry.

Delay Falloff
-Add time offset

Negati
-factor need decimal shift
-vector original needs exposure.

Volume Grid Geometry
-threshold should never be negative.

To Volume Grid
-Points SDF mode may keep Mesh case using separate component?

Grid Array
-WTF is horizontal Vs. vertical?
	-is it still in use?
-> rename to other?
	-> support 3D dimensions

**Join Particles
-add new motion blur id generation system based on the largest number.
	-keep old ID generation system for other random values.
-ID attribute renamed to "Seed" for better clearity of its new use compared to "id".

Polygon Unfolding
-has some minor rotation of transform to prevent bug.
	-is it still happening in 4.5???
-> no I can't seem to find them.
-remove from modifier, because edge cost needs external settings.
	-although doable for sure, but what's the point?
-> also need to support multiple islands for final release.

Set particle parameters
-add warning for removal

Set Stable ID
-should not be deprecated. because id can be drastically different due to realize instance.

Tracer
-auto-remove becomes an option now.
	-it's a bit pointless because turning it off where not be anywhere better.
		-> need a system to detect newly joined geo better.
	-hide the option in resample for the moment.
-for now, normal tracing works.
	-for particles with deletion, must have a stable ID as Seed

Grid Array
-scale should better be default 1 to resolve confusion.
-fix hiding socket issue.

Knit Surface
-fix part broken due to Grid Array Settings.

Filled Mesh circle
-should not have centered UVMap
	-because all Shader nodes input are centered.
	-> center upstream is not really beneficial.

S_Proximity Falloff
-decimal shift should allow 0

Curve Falloff
-support decimal shift

Point Distribute
-it is not working on instances?
	-distribute work on instance, but domain size can't read the first result.

Grid Array
-output attribute.

Time Falloff
-most commonly when it's working with particle system, it should use Birthtime mode.
	-> so change the default to birthtime mode.
-> time mode is still valid, for specific time code from delay falloff & animate node, etc.
	-although more commonly I'm currently using Animate node.

Store UVMap
-support curve & points for point domain.
	-store named attribute in sequence will still overwrite each other.
-> but ideally mesh without face for face corner should also store UV on point domain.

UV Deformer
-automatic curve split with validity

Bend Deformer
-instance mode, rotation & scale recovery also requires global axis.
-fix realize instane issue, so instance mode can also have multiple bend deformer connected.

Motion Variance
-Start Var. should be 0.

UV deformer
-the geometry should be directly passed if no source/UV Map.
-add warnings about source & missing UVMap, etc.

Mix Translucent
-use percentage.
	-too difficult to use decimal shift.

Fade Falloff
-use 100% percentage

UV Deformer
-integrate store UVMap; it's usually needed.
	-will cost performance and thus was not done in the first place.
	-add an toggle for it?

Curve Extrapolation
-decimal shift
-change default value.

Set Curve Radius
-add support to multiply with the original curve radius.
	-decimal shift should be default 0 in such a case?
-> Set Vs. Scale mode.

hair on geometry
-use instance on point method
	-this time automatically record UVMap

Smooth Curve
-Bezier Handle Factor
-Fillet need Decimal Shift

Add: Bezier Handle Viewer

Add: Memory Falloff
-support decay
	-use flat value / string?
		-string can support selection. is it really necessary/helpful?
	-> but then it will require a trigger to make sure new values are included?
-support wave propagation?
	-blur attribute

Add: Paint Wave Solver

S_Vector Noise 
S_Noise Displacement
-support polar coordinate directly inside?
	-the coordinate change must be done through closure.

Proximity falloff
-Instance interpreted as Points/Geo should be in advanced option

Done:
**Menu Switch Selection output
	-mainly to improve the maintainence
	-no functional change.
--bevel curve
--text mesh

World BG
-also disable other ray such as diffuse, glossy, etc.

Directional Falloff
-currently right side is always positive.
	-most of cases it should be reversed.
-> should flip direction by default or flip inside?
	-> best to flip by default. changing internal structure can be a bit risky for versioning.

Paint Wave Solver
-Paint Solver inside should be removed & replaced by nodes.
-falloff needs to be clamped.

Offset towards Camera
-add support to move farther away?
-> rename: Offset to Camera

Face Points
x-update to existing Instance on Element?
	-IOE can have certain issue as in Suzanne knitting example.
		-thus UV tangent can still be very helpful, I don't see a reason to complicate it now.

Follow Curves
-added Absolute Offset

Follow Path Constraint
-fix to fit the nwest follow curves.

Hair on Geometry
-fix Normal & Tangent mode & Extra Rotation in both Mesh & Curve mode.

UV Deformer
-UV shouldn't be a single value.
	-single value evaluation because of warning
-Store UVMap was on multiplier instead of real UVMap

World BG
-must mix with transparent; non-shader means black.

Grid Array
-should realize single layer or all layers?
	-if sequential connection. realizing only single layer can cause confusion.
-> it's one rare kind of array that can be connected in sequence.

Bend Deformer
-offset default should be 0.5
	-since not easy to set without reset default.
	-0 value can be simply slided to the side.
-additional offset is still not influencing the general result for a plane.

Add: Surface Curvature

Paint Wave Solver
-memory falloff also need clamp.
-memory falloff need to allow dynamic geometry instead of constant frozen state.
-check clamp inside & outside differences.
	-clampping inside will diminishing the falloff & wave.
	-> thus only clamp outside.

Solidify
-add settings to disable removal upon enclosed geometry.
	-sometimes need it to get border region of a mesh.
-> in fact solidify modifier always solidify stuff for 2 layers.
	-I'm not sure if it's meaningful to keep the function.

Add: S_Star

Add: S_Random Color

Append Point to Curves
-Append point from start will flip the curve.

Voronoi 3D
-Evolution disappeared in 3D mode.
-Advanced Settings rename to "Advanced"

Separate RGB
-optimization, when separation is 0, no need to calculate texture multiple times.

S_Random Color
x-seed should be showed differently?
	-to indicate ranges?
	-it is vector offset range.
x-should lightness instead of value, otherwise it can be just not dark enough.
	-lightness will make color more whitish/black, but not simply dark.
	-not dark engouh because of value var.

S_Hash Seed
-output vector seed.

Bevel Curve
-cap output go into panel.
	-although less visible, but it should be considered as advanced option anyway.

UVMap Viewer
-severely broken.
	-must ensure the input is on face corner domain.

Hexagonal Array
x-value precision
-for now firstly use more automatic method.
	-also added "set Geo radius".

mix normal by proximity
-value precision

UV Deformer
-mapped normal is broken for align rotation to vector?
	-if the original geo has no Z height, normal was not sampled for efficiency.
	-but it's found out this can be needed.

Add: G_Set Geo Radius
-support Point & Curves.
	-using separate geometry for auto-detection?
		-usually there's no mixture btw points & curves, thus auto the better.

Offset Origin
-absolute offset Vs. Rel Offset

Point Light BG
-use percentage to be more practical

Mirror Modifier
Knit Unit
-Offset Origin change was changing socket value and disrupt the result.
	-fixed.

Mirror Modifer
-custom origin flip Z seems broken.

**Bend Deformer
-additional offset for a plane should influence the origin.
	x-menu for relative offset Vs. absolute offset?
-> if no thickness, use a hard-coded default value of 0.5.
	-mix is un-clamped now and thus can go beyond the range.
-rotation is broken somehow as rotating the whole geometry as well.
	-fixed by adding back invert rotation.
-> rotation clamp improvement.
	-requires rotating the original position as well for a tilted mask.
-if final output realize instance, origin GP preview is broken.
	-fixed
-rotation clamp is on the world origin due to "Rotate Vector".
	-> if the geometry is not centered then mask is broken.
	-> fixed by offset position evaluation.
-add warning of non-instances input in instance mode.
--support rolling using "Inward Pull".
	-clamp & flip clamp support is done.
-XZ-Y & ZY-Z when clamping seems broken?
	-fixed; likely happen since the previous axis picking change by not relying on Z anymore.
****************************************************************************************************
The Newest Test Demo Tree: ZG_09.
To Do:
**Don't Show Manage Panel
	-only for modifier nodes
	-only if related with bake and output attribute.

Paint Wave Solver
-if the temporal sample index is not working properly like for boolean object.
	-how to control outside?
	-> menu with nearest?
-Clean up
	-no need to store W anymore
	x-re-arrange math?
		-resonant needs to be dif from velocity.
		-velocity can have decay, but resonant must not since it's for falloff.

Add: Set Secondary Axis for Rotation
-use align rotation to vector with pivot axis?
-support objects?

Radial Array
-curve circle should have normal facing upwards for easier understanding of axes?

Tracer
-if to use the newly joined geo detection function?
	-[index - (sampled index + 1)]
-what about using detect by id method now?

Temporal Smooth
-need to support newly joined geo as well?

Dynamic Curve Sampling
-add warning as in DSS.

Add: Project UV from View

Offset Origin
Center Geoemtry
-should also output a transform so that invert operation can be possible?

Curve Linear
-The curve has normal inherently facing downwards, why?
-should I set radius at low?

Attribute Viewer
-support face corner with better positioning of the existing vector.

**Deprecating due to existing Assets
-G_Edge Length.

Check Sample Index Vs. Attribute statistic performance again.
********************************************************
5.1:
*Hair on Geometry
-should test about join original geometry?
	-useful if single geo + Single hair gen.
	-but if single geo for multiple hair gen. may not that helpful.
-what about Custom Rotation?
	-seems require closure for normal & tangent.
-investigate why subdivide curve is causing issue without capturing.

*Scene Info.
x-improve Animate interpolation?
	-but curves are not accessible?
		-closure and bundles?
-Is Inside View Still has resolution X and Y issue.
-Delta Time better using inversed frame rate than current calculation.
	otherwise it will cause divide by 0 error.

UV Deformer
-Source rename tob Surface

Points Distribute
-add density in case requirement of switching.

**Inline Toggles.
-Mirror Modifier
	-once the node sizes decreases, add offset function.

	-loop mode should be a panel, enable Loop, Start, End separately.
	-> 1 line to replace the entire previous complex menu.

**InLine output
-Reset Self Object Transform

**Inline output Need Design.
-Helical Connections
-Fill Volume
-Curve Deformer
-UV Deformer
    -custom bounding box Vs. Bounds Preview
-Time Falloff
	-time mode should add delay time option for sequencial event?
		-it seems just similar as the Animate Node.
		-should they be made together?
	-Birthtime should also support delay as in time for sequencial event.
		-how to design?

**Inline output Breaking?
-remap 0-1
-Random Rotation
-Curve Extrapolation?
-Store UVMap
-

**Dynamic Socket Type: effect nodes requiring multiple types.
-Sample in Proximity.
-Inertial Offset
-...

**Curve & Color Ramp Panel.
	-shouldn't be on most nodes, for the sake of remap 0-1 re-usibility.
**support curve Interpolate function outside group using Closure & Bundles.
-Remap Vector Scale
-Sample in Proximity
	-this need external sampling/color ramp so bad.
-layered proximity falloff
-all ease ease function...
-Add: Curve Parameter Interpolate.

**Interface Order
	-panel used to be only possible at bottom of all.
-Match Size.
	-want to add an custom input option if it's possible.
		-in case of dynamic function that requires a bigger bounding box.

**Deprecation after 5.2 LTS:
-Set Curve Tilt Alignment
	-Set Curve Tilt by Normal
-Random Helices Distribution
	-Random Spirals
-Set particle parameters
	-this node should be completely ungrouped and removed to be replaced by Join Particles.
-Hair on Surface
	-integrate into Hair on Geometry?
-Spline Info
	-Curve Info
-G_Boundary Selection
	-warning only if 5.1
-G_Set Curve radius
	-included and replaced by "G_Set Geo radius" to also support points.
	-warning only upto 5.2, remove in 5.4?

**Helical Connections
-Default Vs. Custom mode
	-Amount no longer useful when using custom mode?
-> a sample is done. wait ntl future to depoly it.

**Remove Trash Code:
-cleaning up ZA_19 Curve Deformers
-UV deformer
****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Tree Generator
-Noises displacement is displacing branches out of way.
-need a better interpolation for "over parameter" method.

Array on Curves
-stability issue
	-changing in length can disrupt the array on curves.
	-instance on point mode will be the most stable by length.
		-but instancing method by itself doesn't allow offset along curve.
-> to allow instancing method, need to get the offset to recover the position and parameter?
	-as long as they are resampled, poitns will be moved.
-> difficult to solve it now.

Add Curve Branch
-this one is broken now due to hierarchy issue?
	-Use different modes for Inside Simulation Vs. Inside Loop.

Curve Split
-will lose material set before, because there's conversion within.

Animate
-is having a curve scape goat inside for warning evaluation.

Curve Extrapolation
-can't completley bypass using selection, because curve to mesh has no selection and must happen.
-in some dynamic cases it will switch the curve Index and thus point index too.

Face Points
-Join Vertices Points will cause evaluation disturbance.
	-likely due to sample index disturbance?
-> perhaps better solved by closure to duplicate functions.
	-for now it seems working or not working anyway. pending.
-Dual Mesh doesn't mean the exact vertices location.
	-as avg. point to form polygon for face points can be bad at low subd.
-Join Vertex Points function needs some more thoughts.
	-while it's working on basic case.
	-dynamic case require sampling and capture on respective domain.
		-which is not exposed and has to be done outside.

Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working
	-because they aren't stable relative to geometry?
-basic setup is working.
	-but somehow moving as a whole in complex scene. why?

Tracer
-I think there are cases you don't want to delete trace when they are deleted?

Solidify
-In Instance Mode, Merge by Distance Not Working.

Freeze Geometry
-what if different geometry requiring different status of freeze?
	-switch node can't accept Field.
	-Separate Geometry for Freeze?
		-if the index is changing, what to do?

Set Particle Parameter
-Should Inheret the previous velocity?
	-currently the velocity must be newly written.

Add: Mesh Tangent?
-How to make sure between vertex & face tangent?

Step Extrude
-The stop mode currently doesn't support attribute for multiple polygons.

Bevel Curve
-give warning in Mesh Instances.
	-curve to mesh will work in curve instances wtho realization.
-when used as a modifier for mesh, it will cause lose of material.
	-because of Mesh to Curve step.
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Bevel Curve
-investigate UV Length Multiplier.
	-seems if field is in scale it will be as if it's determined with statistic?
	-but generally still working.

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info?

Helical Connections
-is it possible to auto-detect the decimals when connecting in chains?
	-difficult, so far no success.

Unknown Nodes:
-Group Index, Count Per Island.
-Group per Domain
-Iteration Count per Domain.
	-used to be for repeat zone. but currently questionable.
