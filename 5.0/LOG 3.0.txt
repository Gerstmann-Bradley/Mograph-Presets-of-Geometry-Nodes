Done:
**Decimal Shift default value
	-some default is currently set to 0 in 4.5 for versioning old files.
-Float Range.
	-1
-Curve Linear
	-1
	-need set curve radius at 0.005?
		-but reason it effect bevel curve because of radius support.
-Bevel Curve
	-1
-Helical Connections
	-1
-Sin Function
	-1

**G_Hash Seed
-a better method can be used, but should only be done in 5.0 because of breaking changes.
	-then it will break with Seed change in 5.0

Mirror Modifier
-add Info-warning when bisecting instance, because it shouldn't work anyway.
	-this is a tricky question, because it is actually bisecting.
		-just not accessing the internal structure.
-auto-hide not working on Custom Vs. Self Origin.
	-it's not working, likely due to bad closure inference issues/144870

**Closure and Bundles
	-remove duplication of code
--Mirror Modifier
--Sin Function
	-can remove Sin Unit.

Warning review
--proximity falloff
	-warning
--animate
	-warning
--face points
	-warning
--deprecation warning
	-should be info but keeping as warning.
--bevel Curve
	-interesting example to show what should be info & warning each.
--smooth position
	-good example of info.

*Value Precision.
-remove "on delta time".
	-questionable, since it's an approximation now, better to keep it.
	-because scene info node is not down anyway.

**Remove Trash Code
--UV Deformer
	-but bounding box code from 3.5, because radius was effecting BBox.
--Mirror Modifier

Deprecation:
--Array on Splines
	-Array on Curves
--Alignment on Splines
	-align rotation on Curves
--Follow Splines
	-Follow Curves
--ZC_10b_attribute viewer performance test
-Points Distribute
	--Face Area code

Reset Curve Cyclic
-completely rewrite with Trim Curve at 0.9999.
	-it will break the cyclicity but keep everything working.
	-also extremely fast.

Curve Extrapolation
-Should provide options to break cyclic or not.
-Add Selection
-Distance output will no be field on each point instead of statistic.
	-use signed distance.

Attribute Viewer
-View Value must be set to dynamic instead of Auto. seems a bug somewhere.
****************************************************************************************************
The Newest Test Demo Tree: ZF_16.
To Do:
Offset Origin
Center Geoemtry
-should also output a transform so that invert operation can be possible?

Hair on Geometry
-integrate Hair on Surface into.
	-should also support both Mesh & Curve?

Set Curve tilt by Normal
-Camera tilt often has an issue that whole length can skew the result.
	-may need an operation to only account for an average mid-point?

Curve Linear
-The curve has normal inherently facing downwards, why?

Curve Extrapolation
-it will disrupt the original curve normal.

3D viewer
-if no implicit input, it should output instances.

**Closure and Bundles
	-remove duplication of code
-Add loop for noise.
-Instance for each element?
	-save the point node and index input?
	-how to output attribute without store named attribute?
-Tree Generator
	-is it possible for a more manual version using closure & bundles?
	-what's the difference of it compared to the one by a group node?
-UV Deformer
-Curve deformer, etc.

**UV Deformer
-option to keep dimension or not.
	-some cases may be better to remap a 2:1 ratio into 1:1 UV map?
-mapping preview sometimes may need validity.

**Curve Deformer
	-better to rewrite with closure to remove repetition.
-Clean up for better design?
	-how was instance mode determined?
	-if Extrapolation can be done in path constraint, why not in deformer?
-method: Relative/Normalized Mapping Vs. Absolute World Mapping.
	-the existing workflow are based on relative.
-Mode: Single Vs. Instances
	-Single must be normalized to scale?
	-Instances may be normalized to scale or not?
-> it's found there's a point where for each element becomes more efficient.
	-more complex the output geometry, more efficient it will be.
		-about 168 Vs. 393 ms on 40,40,40 cubes at 2000 count.
		-about 22 Vs. 3.2 ms on 2,2,2 cubes at 2000 count.
	-Regular Suzanne at 2000 count, 41 Vs. 27 ms.
		-subsurf 1, 59 Vs. 89 ms
		-subsurf 2, 202 Vs. 382 ms
-need to have an output to preview curve.
-axis mode needs to have automatic elongation.
	-what about same for bounding box mode?
-axis mode must be using length, because no bounding box to define length.
	-only in bounding box to downgrade it to factor mode?
-Instance for Each Vs. Mapping Instance for Each.
	-automatic detection, instance on point method?
	-should be different mode?

**Socket Shape Struct
	-it would be better if many nodes' socket structure being re-defined instead of automatic.
	-otherwise confusion between dynamic & single value & field value.
********************************************************
5.0:
**Node Output Visibility
-Bounding Box Falloff
-Sin Funciton
-Decay Function?
-Reset Local Transform
	-the geometry & field can be separated into each mode.
-Match Size
	-right now the output is in face corner domain.
		-the domain is set by interface and not exposed for changes.
	-> best to have 2 outputs and swapped by conditions.
-Curve Deformer
	-Instance Index should be exposed. it's good for sampling.
	-need to rewrite mode for Single Vs. Instances?
-Bevel Curve
	-should add an "Are Caps" option.
		-but need to hide in flat mode because no fill caps in flat.
-Radial Array
	-fibonacci mode has its falloff output.
	-right now it's a boolean, but perhaps better as a mode?
-Negati
	-support vector; also need to support dif axis?
	-but will need to be able to hide sockets.
-Modulo Falloff
	-Support Float & Integer with menu?
-Point Distribute
	-output should be automatically hidden.

*Scene Info.
x-improve Animate interpolation?
	-but curves are not accessible?
		-closure and bundles?
-Is Inside View Still has resolution X and Y issue.
-Delta Time better using inversed frame rate than current calculation.
	otherwise it will cause divide by 0 error.

**Inline Toggles.
-Mirror Modifier
-Voxel?
-nodes with Decimal Shift now?
	-Fill Volume.
	-Array on Splines
	-Step Extrusion.
	-braid?
-Solidify
	-Expose Merge by Distance.
		-it will largely improve the performance.
-Loft Curves
	-Count -1 was used for default...
-Value Precision.
	-merge lots of boolean?
-parenting
-Knit
	-may add an vector output for non-center vector?

**Dynamic Socket Type: effect nodes requiring multiple types.
-Sample in Proximity.
-Inertial Offset
-...

**support curve Interpolate function outside group using Closure & Bundles.
	-Remap Vector Scale
-layered proximity falloff
-all ease ease function...
-Add: Curve Parameter Interpolate.

**Separator
	-more of a simple UI thing.
-array on Splines
-Attribute Viewer
-Braid
-Fill Volume
-Sharp Edge wireframe
-Step Extrude
-Displace Deformer

**Interface Order
	-panel used to be only possible at bottom of all.
-Match Size.
	-want to add an custom input option if it's possible.
		-in case of dynamic function that requires a bigger bounding box.

**Curve & Color Ramp Panel.
	-shouldn't be on most nodes, for the sake of remap 0-1 re-usibility.

Deprecation 5.2 LTS:
-Set Curve Tilt Alignment
	-Set Curve Tilt by Normal
-Random Helices Distribution
	-Random Spirals
-Set particle parameters
	-this node should be completely ungrouped and removed to be replaced by Join Particles.
-Hair on Surface
	-integrate into Hair on Geometry?
-Spline Info
	-Curve Info
****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Tree Generator
-Noises displacement is displacing branches out of way.
-need a better interpolation for "over parameter" method.

Add Curve Branch
-this one is broken now due to hierarchy issue?
	-Use different modes for Inside Simulation Vs. Inside Loop.

Animate
-is having a curve scape goat inside for warning evaluation.

Curve Extrapolation
-can't completley bypass using selection, because curve to mesh must happen.

Face Points
-Join Vertices Points will cause evaluation disturbance.
	-likely due to sample index disturbance?
-> perhaps better solved by closure to duplicate functions.
	-for now it seems working or not working anyway. pending.
-Dual Mesh doesn't mean the exact vertices location.
	-as avg. point to form polygon for face points can be bad at low subd.
-Join Vertex Points function needs some more thoughts.
	-while it's working on basic case.
	-dynamic case require sampling and capture on respective domain.
		-which is not exposed and has to be done outside.

Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working
	-because they aren't stable relative to geometry?
-basic setup is working.
	-but somehow moving as a whole in complex scene. why?

Tracer
-I think there are cases you don't want to delete trace when they are deleted?

Polygon Unfolding
-has some minor rotation of transform to prevent bug.
	-is it still happening in 4.5???

Solidify
-In Instance Mode, Merge by Distance Not Working.
-not possible to integrate with step extrusion, because output socket visible.

Freeze Geometry
-what if different geometry requiring different status of freeze?
	-switch node can't accept Field.
	-Separate Geometry for Freeze?
		-if the index is changing, what to do?

Set Particle Parameter
-Should Inheret the previous velocity?
	-currently the velocity must be newly written.

Add: Mesh Tangent?
-How to make sure between vertex & face tangent?

Step Extrude
-The stop mode currently doesn't support attribute for multiple polygons.

Bevel Curve
-give warning in Mesh Instances.
	-curve to mesh will work in curve instances wtho realization.
-when used as a modifier for mesh, it will cause lose of material.
	-because of Mesh to Curve step.
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Bevel Curve
-investigate UV Length Multiplier.
	-seems if field is in scale it will be as if it's determined with statistic?
	-but generally still working.

Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info?

Helical Connections
-is it possible to auto-detect the decimals when connecting in chains?
	-difficult, so far no success.

Tracer
-if to use the newly joined geo detection function?
	-[index - (sampled index + 1)]

Unknown Nodes:
-Group Index, Count Per Island.
-Group per Domain
-Iteration Count per Domain.
	-used to be for repeat zone. but currently questionable.
***************************************************************************************************
Still Considering Necessity:
Add: Array Instancer?

Add: Randomize Instance Order?
-Instance on Point + Random Value + Instance Index
-Is this extra nodes really necessary?
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.

Randomness
-Var. means range between full negative Var. & full positive Var.
-Mid-Level Means 2X Positive/Negative.

Check if All index node are using implicit index attribute than ID/Index.
During Instance and Pick Instance
	-Instance Index should use Index instead of ID?
		-should use ID/Index instead.
	-for example if using Is inside View to select point.
		-instance index will glitch, while ID won't.

Named UVMap should Above Vector input UVMap

tooltips
-use first person for verbs as Blender did.

Decimal Shift:
Shift the decimal point of the above value by powers of 10. Applies division. For example: 2 → divide by 100

Info Vs. Warning
-Info is something done wrong but doesn't effect much result.
	-such as bisecting instance won't work, but you can turn it on or whatever.
-warning is when something is done incorrectly and should be told?
