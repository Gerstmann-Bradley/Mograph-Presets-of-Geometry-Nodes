Done:
**Decimal Shift default value
	-some default is currently set to 0 in 4.5 for versioning old files.
-Float Range.
	-1
-Curve Linear
	-1
	-need set curve radius at 0.005?
		-but reason it effect bevel curve because of radius support.
-Bevel Curve
	-1
-Helical Connections
	-1
-Sin Function
	-1

**G_Hash Seed
-a better method can be used, but should only be done in 5.0 because of breaking changes.
	-then it will break with Seed change in 5.0

Mirror Modifier
-add Info-warning when bisecting instance, because it shouldn't work anyway.
	-this is a tricky question, because it is actually bisecting.
		-just not accessing the internal structure.
-auto-hide not working on Custom Vs. Self Origin.
	-it's not working, likely due to bad closure inference issues/144870

**Closure and Bundles
	-remove duplication of code
--Mirror Modifier
--Sin Function
	-can remove Sin Unit.

Warning review
--proximity falloff
	-warning
--animate
	-warning
--face points
	-warning
--deprecation warning
	-should be info but keeping as warning.
--bevel Curve
	-interesting example to show what should be info & warning each.
--smooth position
	-good example of info.

*Value Precision.
-remove "on delta time".
	-questionable, since it's an approximation now, better to keep it.
	-because scene info node is not down anyway.

**Remove Trash Code
--UV Deformer
	-but bounding box code from 3.5, because radius was effecting BBox.
--Mirror Modifier

Deprecation:
--Array on Splines
	-Array on Curves
--Alignment on Splines
	-align rotation on Curves
--Follow Splines
	-Follow Curves
--ZC_10b_attribute viewer performance test
-Points Distribute
	--Face Area code

Reset Curve Cyclic
-completely rewrite with Trim Curve at 0.9999.
	-it will break the cyclicity but keep everything working.
	-also extremely fast.

Curve Extrapolation
-Should provide options to break cyclic or not.
-Add Selection
-Distance output will no be field on each point instead of statistic.
	-use signed distance.

Attribute Viewer
-View Value must be set to dynamic instead of Auto. seems a bug somewhere.

Curve Extrapolation
-fix disruption of original curve normal.

3D viewer
-if no implicit input, it should output instances.

Curve Extrapolation
-add options to prevent cyclic curve breakage.
-add options for distance relative to length
-need to test index swap.
	-Mesh to Curve will Swap Index.

**Curve Deformer
	-better to rewrite with closure to remove repetition.
-Clean up for better design?
	-how was instance mode determined?
	-if Extrapolation can be done in path constraint, why not in deformer?
-method: Relative/Normalized Mapping Vs. Absolute World Mapping.
	-the existing workflow are based on relative.
-need to have an output to preview curve.
-integrated Curve Extrapolation.
	-worked, although can't be bypassed because of "Curve to Mesh"
-Mode: Single Vs. Instances
	-Single must be normalized to scale?
	-Instances may be normalized to scale or not?
-> it's found there's a point where for each element becomes more efficient.
	-more complex the output geometry, more efficient it will be.
		-about 168 Vs. 393 ms on 40,40,40 cubes at 2000 count.
		-about 22 Vs. 3.2 ms on 2,2,2 cubes at 2000 count.
	-Regular Suzanne at 2000 count, 32 Vs. 26 ms.
		-subsurf 1, 78 Vs. 93 ms
		-subsurf 2, 133 Vs. 318 ms
-> Single Vs. Instances Mode is not needed.
	-it can be directly put into a for each element even for single curve.
		-minimal performance impact.
-Curve Extrapola can't be bypassed internally for cyclic curve.
	-somehow there's a bug in Flow, tried to solve bu no success.
		-anyway it's not required to solve.
	-For each element can bypass it more directly using Geo Switch.
-> However in actual integration these tanks miserably.
	-even just use "Loop Index" will be deadly. looking for answer at issues/144972
-Single Vs. Instances Mode.
	-Single Mode may not be necessary.
	-in 500,500,500 Cube, Single Vs. Instance doesn't differ much.
		-10 Vs. 20 ms; not effected by the curve resolution.
-> Single can be merged into Instances mode.
-Duplicate Vs. Select per Curve
	-Duplica per Curve is automated as previous Instance mode.
	-what about Select per curve?
		-what automation is expected? Per Island? NO.
		-Pick Instance?
			-use the same geometry input for convenience.
			-but need to add warnings.
-> into "Pick Instance".
	-it has its warning too.
--Different Flow
	-it confuses me a lot, but basically only info read by Mesh needs Sampling.
		-the captured Instance Index means 0 if the value is only read by Curve.
--Different Scalings
-Offset Flow is no longer needed? because anyway extrapola is integrated inside.
	-can keep it since it doesn't hurt and properly documented.
-Sampling in Closure may be a bad idea.
	-In case more samplings are required?
	-2 types of Sampling in general.
		-1 can sample outside for each whole curve, need to output an Index
		-2 can sample along curve, can only be done inside.
-Absolute Mode Implementation:
	-should completely bypass the need of Bounding Box & Remap?
		-> No offset panel is needed, because it's done fully on the original axis.
	-world origin 0 is the perfect starting point.
		-distance on the selected x will cover the length of curve.
	-> it relys on the bounding box, just no Normalize and Remap Process.
-In relative mode, geometry is mapped within the range from -1 to +1.
	-> extrapolation was controlled by the "Offset" subject to this region.
-> In absolute mode, no virtual Offset is available.
	-has to sample info from the Mesh.
-Abs mode: can't figure out how to offset BBox & final position separately.
	-it's easier to offset instance as a whole.
	-to simplify the process, sample & capture at the most beginning.
-for some reason, Abs mode has flipped normal on Y & Z and will clip on axis.
	-requires negati in some binormal to work.
-Add Instances Warning if Pick Instance is not on.
-Proportional Scale toggle in Pick Instance.
	-scale different instances based on the largest instances
		-to keep relative scale of them. need attribute statistic?
	-which axis to chose, or based on diagonal?
		-based on forwarding axis.
	-should be disabled in Abs mode.
-Abs Pick bug when using random flow.
	-sampling from Geo to Curve has issue because index doesn't match.
		-solution Ref from Group to Instances.
-Abs Cyclic based on the Max Length of Curve.
-Performance test on 40,40,40 Cube at 2000 Count.
	-274 Vs. 360 ms
	-no significant differences found between modes.
		-Abs mode may fast as 200

Curve Deformer
--Abs mode has a bug in Single Curve
	-forgot to enable back the offset Min bounding box.
--Relative Mode has completely broken Cyclic Curve
	-fulled fixed with proper Sampling max Length on Spline Domain.
--Abs mode on multiple cyclic seems to have bug.
	-also only go positive and no negative.
	-because when it's cyclic, it doesn't neeed offset.
--When the targeted X contains 0, Proportionl scale can be broken.
	-set math maximum at a small value.
		-although it can still result in extreme case, will leave it now.

Scale Selection
-clean up with Closure.

Add: S_Gabor Flow
Add: S_Edge Gradient

Solidify
-was not outputting curves.
	-because of separate component.
	-for the moment curve to mesh automatically.

**Bend Deformer
	-rewrite
--Confirm of original modifier behavior.
	-only work on XY-plane, Z-axis geometry.
		-whole X/Y fold on X/Y Axis.
		-Z-axis, only XZ plane folded on two sides. YZ stays.
--Origin Offset has relevant and irrelevant part.
	-needs to be selected for each mode.
-want to add ability masking the effect.
	-right now offset the origin will bump the other side as well.
	-Origin Offset and such threshold is essentially the same magnitude?
		-it should still work for all types more than just curves
-> the current method is a sharp transition.
	-smooth transition is not possible because it works on the entire geometry.
	-so input will be rather a toggle?
--why XY-Z working for XY test mesh, but not for YZ test mesh?
	-XY test Mesh is moved on X, but YZ test mesh hasn't been moved.
		-so their gradient has been drawn differently.
	-> needs to capture the mixed bounds after movement.
x-give up on flipping the direction while keeping the same offset for the same effect.
	-maybe technically easy, but it may take too many switches for different offset
--support Rotation Value always relative to the bounding box length on axis.
	-for 4m length line, angle pi/2 is enough for a full circle.
		-the multiplication makes it enough for 2 pi circle.
--support Rotate the axis of bending.
	-need 3rd set of axis which influence bend only if axis rotated.
	-currently using "Rotating instance after offset to origin" method.
		-a bit simpler than rotating position on 2 stages separately.
->it has issue if clampping + rotating more than 90 degree.
	-map range requires a larger gradient for smoother transition.
		-but it also makes the result dramatically different from normal state.
	-overall I think it's fine now.
--need to add a viewer system to indicate location and orientation of bending.
	-viewer axis is tricky, but finally decided to use plane-CP-axis
	-multi-viewer markers are confirmed.
	-known issue: viewer marker is done by GP.
		-1. it has to be rendered by GP.
		-2. attribute overlay must be on to give it color.
x-support object absolute offset.
	-no plan for the moment.
	-it should be easy to do, but seem far less productive compared to procedural offset & rot.

**UV Deformer
-add options for Custom Bounding Box?
	-Bounding box have input & output.
-> input can be Vector & Geometry.
-> output can be ???
	-default from 0-1 & -/+Z.
	x-mapped dimension seems barely used?
-Decimal Shift value back to 0. Z-axis recovery should be correct now?
	-may even remove decimal shift, but will keep for now.

Curve Split
-it only output curves, input other geometry are ignored.
	-should have warnings

Sin Function
	-fix issue from decimal shift
--Knit Unit
--Knit Surface
--Braid
--Tree Generator
--Woven Surface

Proximity Falloff
-using new

Helical Connections
-4.5.2 solves the bug. no need to capture tilt anymore.

Hair on Geometry
-integrate Hair on Surface into.
	-should also support both Mesh & Curve?
	-Surface Cling mode
-use new bend deformer.

Woven Surface
-needs spline index on each axis

Curve Deformer
-why sampling Spline Parameter not working?
	-seems working as intended.

default value when sampling on color
	-should make sure black start.
--curve deformer
--array on curves
	-fine already.
--Follow Curves
	-float to color

UV Deformer
-what about capture the vector map value trying to save performance?
	-not improving any performance.
		-also not seem to change any result.
	-will leave it there.

Bevel Curve
-Free Profile has resolution dependency.
	-known bug upstream in Blender.
	-/issues/145103
		-closed

Hair on Geometry
-better to re-arrange some layout.
	-radius better exposed.
	-default value of XY-rot

UV Deformer
-in custom bounding box mapping, if geometry is outside, it will be clamped to be included.
	-> it must be in the targeted UVMap area and deletion is not working.
-> remove clamping of Vector map range so it can extend outside.

Fill Curve Tube
-inner Ring tob a factor of outer ring.
-add evenness setting

Fill Curve Tube
-different count in different rings?
	-it's already doing it
x-radius mode to set count based on radius?
	-tried but didn't work well.

Bend Deformer
-due to split instance, the attribute didn't propagate well.
	-need to sample & captured at Instance before realization.
-> I wonder how many boolean options are needed.
	-currently clamp tob single value, but flip direction is field.

Bend Deformer
x-investigate possibility to shrink the endpoint
	-a multiplier after (1-Angle) can shrink.
		but generally not working well.
		-also how to setup gradient?

Curve Deformer
x-the scale will disrupt the normal rule of flow from 0-1.
	-should a factor be added to resolve it?
-> flow dividing scale seems not to work in this case.
	-I'm also not convinced the benefit of it.
-> in fact, since it's mapped, then no matter the scale.
	flow 0-1 to across the whole length of curve in relative.
	-in absolute it doesn't work because geometry may not be centered on world origin.
		-so it can never be guaranteed.

Add: Set Curve Radius
-only goal is to add decimal shift.

Dynamic Surface Sampling
-simplify.
-add warning
-update test

Hair on Geometry
-add tangent mode for rotation

Random Rotation
x-worth to make Z-only into a menu switch?
	-so that extra XY can be hidden in non-Zonly mode?
-> I think Extra XY is always useful.

Helical Connections
-set curve radius at the end to keep original curve radius.
	-important for hair on geoemtry.

Hair on Geometry
-Surface options all into panel
-improve falloff setup

Curve Split
-automatic set curve radius

Proximity Falloff
x-2nd Scale Offset input?
	-better not, as for better instruction.

**Sin Function
-remap 0-1 is having conflict to Amp*0.1.
	-make a new menu and parameter for modes?
-> why insertion fails?
	-because geometry output is considered.
		-for now a known limitation in blender.

Curve Deformer
-absolute seems respond to deformation but why?
	-it contains bounding box of the original geometry.
	-it's used as kind of statistics?
-> the issue is in the min-bounds used to offset flow?
	-it was always using X instead of XYZ accordingly.

Add: S_Point Light BG

Temporal Smooth position
-initialize mixing by 0 since no input at beginning?
	-> into a panel with panel toggle.

hair on geometry
-surface cling not working if noise displacem is disabled.
	-because they share the same selection on set position


Woven Surface
-automatic resolution incremmeshent?
x-why is edge prominent?
	-because of smooth position.

automatic resolution increment
-Knit Surface

Index Reverse
-when inputting curve, will have unsupported type mesh...
	-in fact it's completely broken
-> how to resolve it?
	-sort element supports spline, check how it looks first.
-> fixed, but seems to have inherited problem.

Curve Deformer
-add noramlzie flow rate based on the curve length.

Hair on Geometry
-when both deforming & surface cling, end tip should snap better.
	-cv the group is getting complicate.
	-may need rewrite for better design?

Knit Surface
-Mode A support output instances

Hair on Geometry
-problematic to have a single falloff to control both length & Radius.
	-in case like surface cling, falloff on length will disrupt target.
-> in fact why falloff on length? it's not visible if radius 0.

Sin Function
-output Cos so that constant phase can be left clean.

Curve Falloff
-Resample into a Panel
-can size of proximity may accept field of a curve.
-all input support field now

Merge Distance Curve
-output into expanded menu.

Add: View Angle Transparency
x-layer weight facing already finishes it.
	-would better to wait for color ramp in node group to solve issue.

Add: Offset towards Camera
-directly working on position will scale down geometry ntl it flips normal.
	-working on offset in current way seems to be perfect

Edge Gradient
-including color ramp inside is really a bad idea.

S_Center UV
-add a scale option

Offset towards Camera
-add decimal shift

Add: S_Separate RGB

Align Rotation to Camera
-expose position to allow single value

Add: S_Polar Coordinate
-use closure to resolve texture issues.

Add: Wave Propagation
-single Wave Vs. multiple wave?
	-right now single wave only.
-in multiple wave, clamp front?

Following Curves
-output parameter
-sampling into panel

S_Vector Noise
-add implicit vector as UV

Dot Product Falloff
-Falloff Normalized to 0-1
-Crude Dot Product output separately.

Add: Store Attribute

**Bend Deformer
	-2nd rewrite
-Mode. Single Vs. Instance

3D viewer
-outputting Point when no Geo input, should also rotated by input.

Add: S_Radial Falloff

Add: S_Flowery Mask

**Translate position
-becomes relative offset
	-relative offset seems more constant to have a consistent speed.

Add: S_Translate position
-for simpler connection than the regular multiple vector math.

Wave Propagate
-forgot color ramp 0-1-0.

Offset towards Camera
-needs to be a modifier
-use % factor; slide by holding shift.

S_proximity falloff
-implicit coordinate
-add value precision

Polar Coordinate
-a more formal testing node tree.

Add: S_Dissipation
-still many issues in design, but will keep for now.
****************************************************************************************************
The Newest Test Demo Tree: ZF_16.
To Do:
Dynamic Curve Sampling
-add warning as in DSS.

Add: S_Random Color

Align Rotation to Points
-investiga rela btw point & normal.
	-thought I defined them wrongly.

Add: Remove Circular Seam ?
-remove cylinder UV Seam.

Hair on Geometry
-does it make sense to have a mix vector for rotation?
	-mix from where to where?

Face Points
-use face tangent vector method.
	-capture subtraction of corner position on face.
-to see how it works on weight?

G_Store Attribute
-add warnings.
	-missing object
	-wrong domain.

**S_ series node redesign.
-Integer Seed is not for generic usage.
	-float point precision on vector attribute is huge.
-> seed in 2 form: float random Vs. Vector Offset
-should offset before or after multiply?
	-> offset after will be better so that less influenced by multiplier above maximum threshold.

Offset Origin
Center Geoemtry
-should also output a transform so that invert operation can be possible?

Add: Memory Falloff?
-use closure?

Mesh Rolling
-it's working with mesh with thickness. but not plane
	-smaller thickness, needs higher center to roll it.
	-if the thickness is 0, center can't be elevated.
-implement different axis?
-investigate the initial portion.

Follow Path Constraint
-investigate its function with curve normal.
	-may need to fix?
-> Add ways to offset so it becomes more clear about the actual direction.

Set Curve tilt by Normal
-Camera tilt often has an issue that whole length can skew the result.
	-may need an operation to only account for an average mid-point?

Curve Linear
-The curve has normal inherently facing downwards, why?
-should I set radius at low?

**Closure and Bundles
	-remove duplication of code
-Add loop for noise.
-Instance for each element?
	-save the point node and index input?
	-how to output attribute without store named attribute?
-Tree Generator
	-is it possible for a more manual version using closure & bundles?
	-what's the difference of it compared to the one by a group node?

Attribute Viewer
-support face corner with better positioning of the existing vector.

**Socket Shape Struct
	-it would be better if many nodes' socket structure being re-defined instead of automatic.
	-otherwise confusion between dynamic & single value & field value.

**Menu Switch Selection output
	-mainly to improve the maintainence
	-no functional change.
--bevel curve
--text mesh

**Deprecating due to existing Assets
-Edge Length Deprecation.

**Face Points
-update to existing Instance on Element?

Check Sample Index Vs. Attribute statistic performance again.
********************************************************
5.1:
**Node Output Visibility
-Bounding Box Falloff
-Sin Funciton
-Decay Function?
-Reset Local Transform
	-the geometry & field can be separated into each mode.
-Match Size
	-right now the output is in face corner domain.
		-the domain is set by interface and not exposed for changes.
	-> best to have 2 outputs and swapped by conditions.
-Curve Deformer
	-Instance Index should be exposed. it's good for sampling.
	-need to rewrite mode for Single Vs. Instances?
-Bevel Curve
	-should add an "Are Caps" option.
		-but need to hide in flat mode because no fill caps in flat.
-Radial Array
	-fibonacci mode has its falloff output.
	-right now it's a boolean, but perhaps better as a mode?
-Negati
	-support vector; also need to support dif axis?
	-but will need to be able to hide sockets.
-Modulo Falloff
	-Support Float & Integer with menu?
-Point Distribute
	-output should be automatically hidden.

*Scene Info.
x-improve Animate interpolation?
	-but curves are not accessible?
		-closure and bundles?
-Is Inside View Still has resolution X and Y issue.
-Delta Time better using inversed frame rate than current calculation.
	otherwise it will cause divide by 0 error.

-Random Helices Distribution
	-Random Spirals
-Set particle parameters
	-this node should be completely ungrouped and removed to be replaced by Join Particles.
-Hair on Surface

**Remove Trash Code:
-cleaning up ZA_19 Curve Deformers
-UV deformer
****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Tree Generator
-Noises displacement is displacing branches out of way.
-need a better interpolation for "over parameter" method.

Add Curve Branch
-this one is broken now due to hierarchy issue?
	-Use different modes for Inside Simulation Vs. Inside Loop.

Animate
-is having a curve scape goat inside for warning evaluation.

Curve Extrapolation
-can't completley bypass using selection, because curve to mesh has no selection and must happen.
-in some dynamic cases it will switch the curve Index and thus point index too.

Face Points
-Join Vertices Points will cause evaluation disturbance.
	-likely due to sample index disturbance?
-> perhaps better solved by closure to duplicate functions.
	-for now it seems working or not working anyway. pending.
-Dual Mesh doesn't mean the exact vertices location.
	-as avg. point to form polygon for face points can be bad at low subd.
-Join Vertex Points function needs some more thoughts.
	-while it's working on basic case.
	-dynamic case require sampling and capture on respective domain.
		-which is not exposed and has to be done outside.

Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working
	-because they aren't stable relative to geometry?
-basic setup is working.
	-but somehow moving as a whole in complex scene. why?

Tracer
-I think there are cases you don't want to delete trace when they are deleted?

Polygon Unfolding
-has some minor rotation of transform to prevent bug.
	-is it still happening in 4.5???

Solidify
-In Instance Mode, Merge by Distance Not Working.
-not possible to integrate with step extrusion, because output socket visible.

Freeze Geometry
-what if different geometry requiring different status of freeze?
	-switch node can't accept Field.
	-Separate Geometry for Freeze?
		-if the index is changing, what to do?

Set Particle Parameter
-Should Inheret the previous velocity?
	-currently the velocity must be newly written.

Add: Mesh Tangent?
-How to make sure between vertex & face tangent?

Step Extrude
-The stop mode currently doesn't support attribute for multiple polygons.

Bevel Curve
-give warning in Mesh Instances.
	-curve to mesh will work in curve instances wtho realization.
-when used as a modifier for mesh, it will cause lose of material.
	-because of Mesh to Curve step.
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Bevel Curve
-investigate UV Length Multiplier.
	-seems if field is in scale it will be as if it's determined with statistic?
	-but generally still working.

Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info?

Helical Connections
-is it possible to auto-detect the decimals when connecting in chains?
	-difficult, so far no success.

Tracer
-if to use the newly joined geo detection function?
	-[index - (sampled index + 1)]

Unknown Nodes:
-Group Index, Count Per Island.
-Group per Domain
-Iteration Count per Domain.
	-used to be for repeat zone. but currently questionable.
