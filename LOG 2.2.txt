Done:
Hexagonal Distribution
-Fix

**Unknown Color Tag
-Index Reverse
-Scale selection
-Offset Field List
-Trigger
	-Dark Blue; blur attribute also doesn't need Geometry input.
-Stretch Falloff
-Temporal Geometry
-Index Mask Falloff
	-Red; just like "Index" node.
-Modulo Falloff
	-Red; just like "Scene Time" node.
-Layered Proximity Falloff
-Collision in Radius
-Mesh Falloff
	-Purple; Vector Distance?
-Center falloff
****************************************************************************************************
To Do:
Attribute Voronoi
-Voronoi on UV surface will result in UV coordinate between (0,0) & (1,1)
	-add a domain to fix it?

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info? 

Collision on Surface
-New Gravity Implementation

Tracer
-Add new way to lock on ID?

Add: Clamp Force?

Add: Collection to Points?

Add: Cumulative Field
-for float instead of vector in the previous Cumulative Force?
	-a different way of "Trigger" system?

Investigate: Bevel Curve
-if 2-point curve, custom cap tilt not working somehow?

Mesh Rolling
-Support Empty and Vector?

Add: Shader Falloff

S_Shader Displacement
-Add: Reveal by Minimum?

Field to Constant
-Redesign?
-Add Rotation Socket.

Collision Deformer
-In Island & Internal Collision, the strength to self should be 0.5.

Investigate: is inside view & curve split?

Add: Simulation Value
-Customizable Scene Time Frame.

Points to Curve.
-Does it improve Curve Connect?

Curve Deformer
-Normalize Flow?

UV Deformer
-Unlock Limitation of UV Min/Max?

Trim Curve Normalize / Normalize Curve Length
********************************************************
*Geometry Type Node
-Index Viewer?

*Loop Index Node
-Solver
-Set Branch Radius
-Layered Proximity Falloff
-

4.2:
**Matrix Node
Add: Offset to Camera
Reset Self Object Transform?

Parallel Loop
-Measurement
-Attribute Viewer
-

Align Rotation to Vector?
--Align Rotation to Velocity

**Header Change

Axes to Rotation
-Alignment on Splines
-Follow Splines
-Dynamic Surface Sampling
-Dynamic Curve Sampling
-Parenting
-Local Offset
ZD_09b

**Domain Support
-Normalize Field
-Group Per Domain
-3D Viewer
-Remap Vector to Bounds

**Multiple Attribute Captures
-various attribute info?
****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working because they aren't stable relative to geometry?

Tracer
-Dynamic Attribute such as age and falloff will be lost before.
	-This is unavoidable because these attribute are captured upon join.
	-Curve Age is implemented, others requires sample Index.
-If Points are Deleted, tracer will be disrupted.

Temporal Value
-Not Functioning now because for field it requires geometry.
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Instance Bounding Box
-known using local axis.
	-Split to Instances can reset axis to global.
		-the question is what group ID to use. what's the common use case?
-solved by adding global axis now.

Bend Deform
-Angle Check?

Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Add: Recalculate Normal
-Face normal comparing to Vertex & Edge Normal method?
	-Split edge will offset all local information. all normal to be 0,0,1.
	-flipped face normal leads to flipped vertex normal.
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.

Randomness
-Var. means range between full negative Var. & full positive Var.
-Mid-Level Means 2X Positive/Negative.

Check if All index node are using implicit index attribute than ID/Index.
