Done:
Add: Inertial Offset
-Mix Study.
	-Offset= Mix Position - Position.
-Sphere Bug Study?
	-can't reproduce sometimes; Unknown.
-Trigger Time Study; Replace with Trigger.
	-Don't remember how i fixed it but i fixed it somehow; tested multiple times.

Add: Capture Velocity
-Store named Attribute Method to minimize the need of multiple linkage and socket output.

Bevel Curve
-Separate Component to keep non-curve mesh in the output?
	-this will enforce the UV capture within the node group; not sure desirable.

**Append Points to Curve
-Spearate Geometry and join geometry method will shuffle spline index.
-Rewrite with New Performance test.
	random helices 2000x1500; performance 180 ms for all 3 methods.
-Do I need to Evaluate on Domain?
	-curve Normal and Tangent will break.

Index Reverse
-somehow spline index 10 is missing between 9 to 11.
	-likely due to domain.
10 missing from map range?
	-Bug Report.

Curve Intersection Detections
-Add Additional Collider
****************************************************************************************************
TTo Do:
Bend Deform
-Angle Check

Index Randomize
-Group Index Bug?

**Falloff - Delete Min/Max options
-to decrease node sizes to allowing more options?
-Remap 0-1 is used more frequently than native min-max.
DelayFalloff
Directional Falloff
Radial Falloff
Proximity Falloff
Bounding Box Falloff

Array on Splines
-Can custom parameters be captured for later?

Trigger
-Trigger Evaluation below Trigger Time?
-Add Custom Scene time?


Index Reverse
-somehow spline index 10 is missing between 9 to 11.
	-likely due to domain.
10 missing from map range?
	-Bug Report

Add: Simulation Switch

Curve Intersection Detections
-no need to 
****************************************************************************************************
**Serial Loop Node
Add: Index Viewer

Add: Relaxation Solver
	-Note about Performance improvement about breaking the Loop.
		-Stop evaluation once it's completed.
		-Stop statistics if equal to the last.
Add: Dynamic Radius Solver

Random Index per island?

Instance Bounding Box
Bounding Box Falloff for Instance?

Add: Fill Curve Volume?
-Interpolate Curve Method not working.
	-endpoint will be attracted by the guide instead of filling the volume.
-Loop Method.

New Proximity Falloff?
-layered Evaluation


**Simulation Nodes
Start Time, Elapsed Time, Previous Position, Velocity Attribute?
-Store Named Attribute/linkage and their usage tends to scatter around, and thus unlikely benefit from presetizing.

Curve Raycast Collision Detection?
-done.
Branching Thickness Decrement?

Follow Velocity?
-Done as "Capture Velocity"
****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Multi Switch needed
-Curve Deform
-Directional Falloff
-Radial Falloff
-Group Per Domain
-Follow Splines
-Array on Splines
-Remap Vector by Bounds
-3D Viewer
-Orientation Switch


Add: Origin Offset.
-Too complicate without enum node.

Object Coordinate
-Different Order of Operation is required in different cases.
	-wait for Enum List?/Switch?

Solidify
-Merge by Distance is merging other points too.
	-no way to resolve it.

Index Randomize.
-Group Index? -Failed

Proximity Falloff
-Add Absolute scale Offset?
	-can Change mini of Map range 0.
	-but is adding a new socket necessary?

Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Curve Deformer
-Investigate Necessity of Vector Remap.

**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.
