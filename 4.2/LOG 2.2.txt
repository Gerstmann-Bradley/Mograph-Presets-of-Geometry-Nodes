**Multiple Attribute Captures
--Attribute Mesh
--Attribute Spline
--Attribute Instance

	-set to Y for bending object on Z

Solidify
-Normal Displacement method not good for instances?
	-When sampling offseted starting vertices, domain matters.
	-Separage Component of mesh and instance and extrude respectively and join together.
-The Single Solidify Method on Instance Mode, has no midlevel functionality.
	-set position is working on instance domain instead of per vertices
	-Normal isn't preserved anywhere as well.
->Separate Component.
	-If Mesh, use single Solidify Method.
	-If Instance, use Double Solidify Method.
-remove Shade-Smooth added by extrude node

Pi Factor
-Pi and Half Exponent should be added separately.
-Add Tau Factor

Inertial Offset
-Use Implicit Geometry Input and Sample Index to output constant.

Random Color
-use Abs. Randomness for Hue since it's loopable with fraction.
-Saturation also Abs.

UV Deformer
-Add UVMap output.

UV Deformer
-Optimize Sample UV Surface with Capture Attribute.
	-Less Sample Normal -> 2X faster
	-Sample Position will not be improved if no points Deleted.

Viewport Render Count
-a different name for Switch -> Switch Status

Bevel Curve
-Sphere Cap can't take negative radius
	-Statistic was using greater than 0.
		->abs value greater than 0.

Combine 3D Viewer and Attribute Viewer?
-For now no. Combination likely will result in a very large node.

Bounding Box Falloff
-Remove Geometry Output?
	-Use Sample Method?
	-What if need to use Bounding Box Falloff to far distance?
		-better to capture immediately.

Implicit Geometry
-use geometry to instance & instance to point method instead of domain size method?
	-NO, geometry to instance currently will even make empty geometry into instance.

Remap Vector to Bounds
-Should Include set for custom Min-Max of bounding box.

Index Seed
-Seed clamp no longer needs to be non-0.

Add: Mirror Modifier
-What was the expectation?
	-reference point on world origin.
		-not relying on other object for centering.
-Complete Bisecting when over-cross?
	-note Actual Modifier doesn't has bisect evaluation when overcrossed.
		-Current Implementation is because boolean is not unlimited enlarged?
	-Remove the Implementation of Over-cross.
-Support Mesh, Curve, Point Clouds.

Add: Follow on Splines
-for Transform Geometry.
	-Sample Index on all outputs?
	-why not just instance on points even for single geometry?

Randomness
-Investigate Randomness Vector on Scale
	-The Avg was multiplied with another normalized randomness.
		-and thus even if Var. 0, Avg still cause randomness regardless of Mid-Level.
	->removing this algorithm.

Add: Follow Path Constraint.
-what's the purpose?
	-Original Follow Path Constraint can't read GN modified Curve.

Investigate: Bevel Curve
-if 2-point curve, custom cap tilt not working somehow?
	-seem to be fixed in 4.2 now; related to previous negative value bug?

Add All Shader Presets.

-Add Seed Per Frame

Animate
-Add Time output in case for further manipulation.

S_Value Precision
-tag.

Attribute Mesh
-Can only capture once, and evaluate on domain twice instead?
	-Store Point Domain to Face domain require extra cost.
		-this cost will be reflected on whichever parts eventually.
	-> evaluate on domain won't really help anything.

Curve Deformer
-regarding the change of unknown since 4.1.
	-the unknown part is used to normalize the scale of input object into max 1 while keeping the dimension ratio.
		-thus, no mater how big is the geometry,
			it will be in the view of entire curve length due to normalization.
		-this is very helpful for extremely huge object.
	-now it's made into a toggle with default on.

Tracer
-Sample Index on Point Domain by Spline Index.
	-to Transfer some attribute?
		-if it's named attribute, hard to determine type.
	-currently transfer float & vector.
		-in the future should Sample by ID in case points are deleted?

S_Noise Displacem
S_Voronoi Displacem
-add Seed

S_
Add: Hash Seed.
Add: Vector Seed

Inertial Offset
-Implicit Point in Simulation Joint Particles when there's none being needed yet.
	-what to do? -> move points to miles away.

S_Transparent Shadow Ray
-Add Transparency Slider.

Mirror Modifier
-Possible to Support Instance?
	-can remove the effect of bisect, or automatic realize instance?
	-Currently using Instance to Points and Points to Instance Method.
		-> it doesn't respect the orientation.
	-Use Instance instead of Points.

Add: Track to Constraint.
-Blender Constraint can't take evaluated curve.
	-neither mesh curve nor geometry curve, in fact no modifier evaluation at all.
	-Empty can't take Follow Path Constraint.
	-Geometry Can't be Aligned to Geometry.
-Support Align to Point on Curve.
-Normal Object Don't need to worry about it?
	-how to better design the need of Follow Curve Mode Vs. Target Object Mode?

Curve Extrapolation
-Curve to Mesh & Mesh to Curve will eliminate all Curve Radius
	-fix by Capture & Set Curve Radius again.

Spherical Geo
-Add: Dual Mesh Icosahedral method

S_Vector Seed
-Vector should not be input into Hash-Seed

Add: S_Dot Product Cartoon

-The Falloff Animation was accidentally set default to 0.5.
	-should only be done until next LTS.

Add: Snap to Surface

Bevel Curve
-Allow Mesh input?

Relaxation Solver
-need to work on instances
	-Instance to Point -> relax and Sample Position.

	-should be more a template instead of a group node.
	especially if float curve/color ramp not accesible.

Remove: Cloud Shadow
-move into my own GN Asset library.

S_Time Info
-Offset was 0.5, needs to be 0.

Add: S_Self Object Seed
-Implicit Object Coordinate + Object Location.
	-need output both coordinate & Seed.

Bevel Curve
-Previous Separate Component forgot "Instance" domain.
-Turns into A modifier too.

Remap 0-1
-Input value to be a slider for 0-1 range.

Curve Deformer
-Upon Instance for Each, it's important to know the instance index.

Set Curve Tilt Alignment
-use Default Tilt unless otherwise indicated?
	->There's a cost of attribute statistic check in geometry switch.
		-Cost of add a new boolean to this node?
	-Is it really necessary?
		-> Otherwise will have to swap between with tilt.
-> Can use selection on Set Curve Normal.

S_Noiser
-Rename: S_Vector Noise for consistency.

Viewport Render Count
-Switch Status -> "Is Render"

Tree Generator
-Using Power Decay instead of Decay Function?
	-Decay Function is setting range between 0-1 better than power Decay?

S_Polar Coordinate
-Remove Seam
	-seem not possible.
-Add ways to rotate the coordinate upstream
	-math node downstream.

Instance Bounding box
-Add "as a whole" option using instance to points method.
	-Use a menu switch instead of checkbox.

Add: S_Sin Function

S_Transparent Shadow Ray
-Add Invert Function to show only shadow.

Add: Radial Instancer
-position + rotation.

***Random Transform
-In large scale of Translation
	the wiggling happens in local area with high frequency instead of floating far away.
-In high count, many instances are Spawned at the same location
	-Seed is not giving random Position for High Count
-> Vector Seed shouldn't be 1D.
	-Remove dimension in Hash Seed.
-> Simplify.
****************************************************************************************************
To Do:
Investigate the use of Separate geometry by Index

Mirror Modiifer
-the duplicated geo not inheret material?

Dynamic Radius Solver
Dynamic Radius Simulation
-Support Instance just like Relaxation Solver.

Curve Deformer
-Flow% is based on % and sometimes causes a delay because of length difference.
	-add an option to normalize the length.
	-also to consider the effect of start length.

Add: View Transform
-Measure

Reset Self Object Transform.
-What if for normal?
-Is there a better way that can exert everything before?
	-Tree Tilt example.

Add: Fill Cup node?
-when have an top-open cylinder, fill volume inside for liquid.

Sample in Proximity
-Doesn't sounds to be a good design honestly?

Edge of Face
-without Geometry?
-Optimization workflow?

Add: Dynamic Epsilon?
-for epsilon used in large number comparison, such as ID.
	-should be based on how many digits to have?

Attribute Voronoi
-Voronoi on UV surface will result in UV coordinate between (0,0) & (1,1)
	-add a domain to fix it?

Collision on Surface
-New Gravity Implementation
	-add new Bounce Attribute.
		-every collision decreases the energy of bounce and finally stops.
Colliion in Ray
-Backwards Collision Detection Implementation?

Add: Collection to Points?

Add: Cumulative Field
-for float instead of vector in the previous Cumulative Force?
	-a different way of "Trigger" system?

Mesh Rolling
-Support Empty and Vector?

Add: Shader Falloff?

Field to Constant
-Redesign?
-Add Rotation Socket.
	-statistic node doesn't have rotation?
	-what if stay on vector?
-what if using Sample node instead of statistic?
-no longer needed since 4.3?

Collision Deformer
-In Island & Internal Collision, the strength to self should be 0.5.

Curve Connect
-Does Points to Curve improve the algorithm?

Curve Deformer
-Normalize Flow?

UV Deformer
-Unlock Limitation of UV Min/Max?

Trim Curve Normalize / Normalize Curve Length
********************************************************
4.3:
**Loop For Each Element.
-Measurement
-Attribute Viewer
-3D Viewer?
-Layered Proximity Falloff?
-Array on Curve.
-Follow Splines
-Tree Generator
-Curve Deformer
-**Is it still required to work on Instances?
	-Bounding Box falloff.
	-Curve Deformer.

*Loop Index Node
	-Element needs to be based on domain?
		-for 4.3 no longer needed?
-Solver
-Set Branch Radius
-Layered Proximity Falloff
-

**Node Default Width.

**Random Transform 4.3
-In case of Hash Value on Seed.
	-Freq works for 0. not sure why?

**Vector Rotate into Rotate Vector
-Mesh Rolling

Add: Serial Accumulate Field?
-instead of group ID in a group.
	-grouping and accumulate sequentially?
----------------------------------
***For 5.0+:
Falloff Animation Design.
-Should be in range from 0-1.
	-before 5.0 it's set to 0-2 with soft clamp at 1.
		This is to ensure it's easy to change the value and reset value.
	-from 4.2, reset value can be done directly to default value instead of 0.
		I think the clamp shouldn't be so in the future.
	-change delayed for integrity of many tutorials.
-Proximity Falloff
-Center Falloff
-Mesh Falloff

Camera Info:
Add: Offset to Camera
	-Needs Camera Info Also though.
Tilt Alignment
-When towards camera, should also consider screenspace so slent tilt for variations.

**Domain Support
-Normalize Field
-Group Per Domain
-3D Viewer
-Remap Vector to Bounds
-Group to Instances

**In case Sample Node into Multiple Linkages:
****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working because they aren't stable relative to geometry?

Tracer
-Dynamic Attribute such as age and falloff will be lost before.
	-This is unavoidable because these attribute are captured upon join.
	-Curve Age is implemented, others requires sample Index.
		-> Implemented.
-If Points are Deleted, tracer will be disrupted.
	-Temporary Sample by ID is implemented.

Temporal Value
-Not Functioning now because for field it requires geometry.
-Too lazy to fix now.

Polygon Unfolding
-has some minor rotation of transform to prevent bug.
-

Float Range
-Only working on Point Domain.

Solidify
-In Instance Mode, Merge by Distance Not Working.

S_Vector Seed
-Currently Seed all Positive Value.
	-Too lazy to build the Switch.

Modulo Falloff
-is based on integer.
	-What if I want to be based on float?

Freeze Geometry
-what if different geometry requiring different status of freeze?
	-switch node can't accept Field.
	-Separate Geometry for Freeze?
		-if the index is changing, what to do?

Set Particle Parameter
-Should Inheret the previous velocity?
	-currently the velocity must be newly written.

Add: Mesh Tangent?
-How to make sure between vertex & face tangent?

Tracer
-I think there are cases you don't want to delete trace when they are deleted?
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Bend Deform
-Angle Check?

Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Add: Recalculate Normal
-Face normal comparing to Vertex & Edge Normal method?
	-Split edge will offset all local information. all normal to be 0,0,1.
	-flipped face normal leads to flipped vertex normal.

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info?
***************************************************************************************************
Still Considering Necessity:
Add: Array Instancer?

Add: Randomize Instance Order?
-Instance on Point + Random Value + Instance Index
-Is this extra nodes really necessary?
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.

Randomness
-Var. means range between full negative Var. & full positive Var.
-Mid-Level Means 2X Positive/Negative.

Check if All index node are using implicit index attribute than ID/Index.
