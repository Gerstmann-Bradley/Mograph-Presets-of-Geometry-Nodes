Add: Islands to Instances
-Output to be instances

Cell Fracture
-Built in Islands to Instances.
-Remove Counter.

Point Distribute
-Selection input in Distribute Point node is applied after the whole operation.

**Multiple Attribute Captures
--Attribute Mesh
--Attribute Spline
--Attribute Instance
-Attribute Island
	-had no multi capture.
--Curve Deformer

	-set to Y for bending object on Z

Solidify
-Normal Displacement method not good for instances?
	-When sampling offseted starting vertices, domain matters.
	-Separage Component of mesh and instance and extrude respectively and join together.
-The Single Solidify Method on Instance Mode, has no midlevel functionality.
	-set position is working on instance domain instead of per vertices
	-Normal isn't preserved anywhere as well.
->Separate Component.
	-If Mesh, use single Solidify Method.
	-If Instance, use Double Solidify Method.
-remove Shade-Smooth added by extrude node

Pi Factor
-Pi and Half Exponent should be added separately.
-Add Tau Factor

Inertial Offset
-Use Implicit Geometry Input and Sample Index to output constant.

-Saturation also Abs.

UV Deformer
-Add UVMap output.

UV Deformer
-Optimize Sample UV Surface with Capture Attribute.
	-Less Sample Normal -> 2X faster
	-Sample Position will not be improved if no points Deleted.

Viewport Render Count
-a different name for Switch -> Switch Status

Bevel Curve
-Sphere Cap can't take negative radius
	-Statistic was using greater than 0.
		->abs value greater than 0.

Combine 3D Viewer and Attribute Viewer?
-For now no. Combination likely will result in a very large node.

Bounding Box Falloff
-Remove Geometry Output?
	-Use Sample Method?
	-What if need to use Bounding Box Falloff to far distance?
		-better to capture immediately.

Implicit Geometry
-use geometry to instance & instance to point method instead of domain size method?
	-NO, geometry to instance currently will even make empty geometry into instance.

Remap Vector to Bounds
-Should Include set for custom Min-Max of bounding box.

Index Seed
-Seed clamp no longer needs to be non-0.

Add: Mirror Modifier
-What was the expectation?
	-reference point on world origin.
		-not relying on other object for centering.
-Complete Bisecting when over-cross?
	-note Actual Modifier doesn't has bisect evaluation when overcrossed.
		-Current Implementation is because boolean is not unlimited enlarged?
	-Remove the Implementation of Over-cross.
-Support Mesh, Curve, Point Clouds.

Add: Follow on Splines
-for Transform Geometry.
	-Sample Index on all outputs?
	-why not just instance on points even for single geometry?

Randomness
-Investigate Randomness Vector on Scale
	-The Avg was multiplied with another normalized randomness.
		-and thus even if Var. 0, Avg still cause randomness regardless of Mid-Level.
	->removing this algorithm.

Add: Follow Path Constraint.
-what's the purpose?
	-Original Follow Path Constraint can't read GN modified Curve.

Investigate: Bevel Curve
-if 2-point curve, custom cap tilt not working somehow?
	-seem to be fixed in 4.2 now; related to previous negative value bug?

Add All Shader Presets.

Point Distribute
-Add Seed Per Frame

Animate
-Add Time output in case for further manipulation.

S_Value Precision
-tag.

Attribute Mesh
-Can only capture once, and evaluate on domain twice instead?
	-Store Point Domain to Face domain require extra cost.
		-this cost will be reflected on whichever parts eventually.
	-> evaluate on domain won't really help anything.

Curve Deformer
-regarding the change of unknown since 4.1.
	-the unknown part is used to normalize the scale of input object into max 1 while keeping the dimension ratio.
		-thus, no mater how big is the geometry,
			it will be in the view of entire curve length due to normalization.
		-this is very helpful for extremely huge object.
	-now it's made into a toggle with default on.

Tracer
-Sample Index on Point Domain by Spline Index.
	-to Transfer some attribute?
		-if it's named attribute, hard to determine type.
	-currently transfer float & vector.
		-in the future should Sample by ID in case points are deleted?

S_Noise Displacem
S_Voronoi Displacem
-add Seed

S_
Add: Hash Seed.
Add: Vector Seed

Inertial Offset
-Implicit Point in Simulation Joint Particles when there's none being needed yet.
	-what to do? -> move points to miles away.

S_Transparent Shadow Ray
-Add Transparency Slider.

Mirror Modifier
-Possible to Support Instance?
	-can remove the effect of bisect, or automatic realize instance?
	-Currently using Instance to Points and Points to Instance Method.
		-> it doesn't respect the orientation.
	-Use Instance instead of Points.

Add: Track to Constraint.
-Blender Constraint can't take evaluated curve.
	-neither mesh curve nor geometry curve, in fact no modifier evaluation at all.
	-Empty can't take Follow Path Constraint.
	-Geometry Can't be Aligned to Geometry.
-Support Align to Point on Curve.
-Normal Object Don't need to worry about it?

-Support Instance just like Relaxation Solver.

Add: Array Instancer

Offset Origin
-Not working for curves?
-add transform so that it can help transform?

S_Polar Coordinate
-Remove Seam
	-seem not possible.
-Add ways to rotate the coordinate upstream
	-math node downstream.

Investigate: Why Bevel Curve Custom fill cap requires realize instance?

Modulo Falloff
-is based on integer.
-What if I want to be based on float?

Sample in Proximity
-Doesn't sounds to be a good design honestly?

Loop Index
-Element may also needs to be based on domain?

Edge of Face
-without Geometry?
-Optimization workflow?

Set Particle Parameter
-Should Inheret the previous velocity?
	-currently the velocity must be newly written.

Add: Mesh Tangent?
-How to make sure between vertex & face tangent?

Add: Dynamic Epsilon?
-for epsilon used in large number comparison, such as ID.
	-should be based on how many digits to have?

Attribute Voronoi
-Voronoi on UV surface will result in UV coordinate between (0,0) & (1,1)
	-add a domain to fix it?

Collision on Surface
-New Gravity Implementation
	-add new Bounce Attribute.
		-every collision decreases the energy of bounce and finally stops.

In case Sample Node into Multiple Linkages:


For 5.0+:
Falloff Animation Design.
-Should be in range from 0-1.
	-before 5.0 it's set to 0-2 with soft clamp at 1.
		This is to ensure it's easy to change the value and reset value.
	-from 4.2, reset value can be done directly to default value instead of 0.
		I think the clamp shouldn't be so in the future.
	-change delayed for integrity of many tutorials.
-Proximity Falloff
-Center Falloff
-Mesh Falloff
****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working because they aren't stable relative to geometry?

Tracer
-Dynamic Attribute such as age and falloff will be lost before.
	-This is unavoidable because these attribute are captured upon join.
	-Curve Age is implemented, others requires sample Index.
		-> Implemented.
-If Points are Deleted, tracer will be disrupted.
	-Temporary Sample by ID is implemented.

Temporal Value
-Not Functioning now because for field it requires geometry.
-Too lazy to fix now.

Polygon Unfolding
-has some minor rotation of transform to prevent bug.
-

Float Range
-Only working on Point Domain.

Solidify
-In Instance Mode, Merge by Distance Not Working.

S_Vector Seed
-Currently Seed all Positive Value.

****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Bend Deform
-Angle Check?

Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Add: Recalculate Normal
-Face normal comparing to Vertex & Edge Normal method?
	-Split edge will offset all local information. all normal to be 0,0,1.
	-flipped face normal leads to flipped vertex normal.

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info? 
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.

Randomness
-Var. means range between full negative Var. & full positive Var.
-Mid-Level Means 2X Positive/Negative.

Check if All index node are using implicit index attribute than ID/Index.
