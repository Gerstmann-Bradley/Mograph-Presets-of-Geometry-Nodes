Done:
Loft Curves
-Guide Resampling rename -> Guide Count
-Cross Resampling rename -> Cross Count

**3D Viewer
-use Set GP Color
	-Width tob Radius.
-Fix Default Axis Enum Issue
-slow GP render if too many layers.
	-merge layers also slow.
	-> conversion after instances to keep into single layer.
-Mesh method is a little faster in nodes, but rendering is slower

**Curve to Mesh: now on it's using "Scale".
-the radius no longer effects the thickness.
	-versioning is using the radius to prevent breaking tutorials.
-when to break the old tutorial? how to set it up?
	-> not to break the tutorial; still using the radius.
		-in the future add a use radius option.
-> change from practice, the Scale should now accept a field; multiplied by radius.

Bevel Curve
-Scale now supports field. Radius Compatibility ensured.
-Length Multiplier not working with scale well.
	-because the the Profile Length is a fixed number now.
-UV by Length Can be Removed due to Length Multiplier
	-done
-Improve the Cap UV auto-scaling.
-clean up & add comment.

Add: Mix Normals by Proximity
	-set mesh normal node: pulls/132583

	-Expand & Shrink.
--Value Precision
--Grid Distribution
--Bevel Curve
	-Profile
	-Cap Shape
	x-UV by Factor & Index
--Float Range
	-Step Selection can be removed.
		-It was more of a clear way to make sure input in Selection socket.
	-Exclude Ednpoint must not be inlined with previous step selection.
		-will cause confusion of input and output value.
--Curve Linear
	-Step & Stop
	-XYZ

--Step Extrusion
--Rod
--Align Rotation to Point
--Parenting
	-Original Vs. Relative
--Reset Local Transform
	-original Vs.relative.
	-can't deal wth geometry & Vector; since output can't be hidden.

Remove Named Attribute from Curve to Mesh Change
	-replaced with radius node.
	-previously, radius has to be passed for Bevel Curve.
		-but not it's no longer required?
		-keep for versioning, since Bevel Curve is still counting radius.
--Helical Connections
	-yes able to?
	-re-arrange Capture Attribute for both index and radius.
x--Bevel Curves
	-removed one, keep others for now. end result is the same.
x--Curve Extrapolate?
	-if radius doesn't exist, radius node attribute by itself will just be 0.
--Proximity Falloff
	-there is a curve to mesh inside; removable'
--Curve Split
--Sample in Proximity

**New Instance Bounds node
	-at the moment seems broken: issues/138598?
		->not broken, but local needs instance transform.
--Instance Bounding Box.
	-about 2X faster than before.
-Bounding Box Falloff
	-unfortunately no prominent places that can improve the design

**Proximity Falloff Updates
	-right now advanced contains 3 separate Range.
		-although bad for maintainence.
		-but 3 parameters likely will need completely different settings.
x-Mix Normals by Proximity
	-exclude from advanced setting because likely not needed.
--Center Falloff
--Mesh Falloff
--Spline Falloff?

Float Range
-Support Different Domains

Modulo Falloff
-write to replace map range method.
-threshold method improvement
-compare still has to be float to support threshold.

**Expanded Enum Socket
x-Modulo Falloff
	-even splitting to integer & float mode, map range is still float?
--Attribute Viewer
x-Get UVMap
	-enum visibility to switch between modes?
		-Obj Vs. Custom Geometry
	-doesn't simplify anything.
	-if into a modifier, not meaningful to switch enum.
--Index Converge
	-is used in "array on Spline"
		-duplicate element can't be used because its index is serial instead a group.
--Curve Connect
	-not very important?
	-done serial and parallel.
	-but likely needs a complete rewrite and re-design.
		-how to define how many curves in parallel?

**Curve Connect
-rewrite with Points to Curve
	-remember to keep radius

**Expanded Enum Socket
x--Record Velocity
	-made into Menu, but not expand it.

Loft Curves
x-index output?
	-if it's just index value arranged differently. what's the point?

Boolean Toggle of Panel.
x-Loft Curves
	-Advanced Options for Caps.
		-grid subdivsion for caps?
		-how to do that? not even done in Bevel Curve for custom profile.
x-Curve Resampling
	-Points Preview toggle; for radius, use radius?
	-not yet important.

Tracer: removed from known issue
--Dynamic Attribute such as age and falloff will be lost before.
	-This is unavoidable because these attribute are captured upon join.
	->Curve Age is implemented, others requires sample Index.
		-> Implemented.
--If Points are Deleted, tracer will be disrupted.
	->Temporary Sample by ID is implemented.

Float Range
--Stop Mode is not used at 0, but it's still shown as occupied.
	-resolved in new.
-> Removed from known issue.

3D Viewer
-Boolean Toggle for Rotation

attribute Mesh
-split edges are too slow, off by default. and support field.

**Bounding Box is using Radius Now
	-generally not changing anything, but still to remove some in case?
--UV Deformer
	-remove radius
--Bounding Box Falloff
	-remove.
--Mirror Modifier on Mesh

test: ZA_11A
-deleted, it was made before instance attribute is supported
	-so index converge is needed.

mirror modifier
-there's a warning for point cloud due to flip face.
	-disable it since the output won't change.
-for point clouds, flip works, bisect not?
	-build test for is inside volume.

is inside volume
-the direction input shouldn't be normlaized.
	-it can used to calculate length.
-> base multiplier of length by 1000 now.
	so that normalized factor can be 1000 meter.

UV Deformer
-update test & Z-axis factor.
	-don't know why using pi in negati but seems working.

Edge Distance
-rename: Edge Length
	-length is a term used more.

Knit
-change order and default parameters.
	-the reason it uses stop because very difficult for small value?

-can't reove edge parameter.
	-curve segment length value on per point instead of per segment.

hexagonal distribution
-fix curve linear change internally.

Float Range

		-keep for now but still need geometry input anyway.
	--Group to Instance
		-different modes include using Bounding Box Center?
			-how to get bounds before split to instance?
	--index converge
		-used in curve connect & array on Splines
		-replaced by domain size.
		-geometry input needed to specific geometry.
			-add domain support by iteration count per domain.
	x-Index List Length
		-it's also important to get a single value.
		-sample index is costy.
	x-index offset
		-feel a bit lost with this design.
		-max is used for group index (ID) for iteration in repeat zone.
	x-is enclosed geometry
		-but what about the value? should be a constant or field?
	--Iteration Count per Domain
		-it's only used in attribute viewer.
		-not requiring sophisticated code.
		-replace statistic wth domain size.
	x-Is Enclosed Geometry
		-slower than attribute statistic
	x-layered proximity falloff
		-not important and useful in the moment.
	x-loft curves
	x-parenting
		-require a constant for transform node.
	x-Point Distribute
		-sum is replicable by accumulate field.
			-same performance as statistic
		-but it still requires a single value.
	x-relaxing Point
		-need a constant for switch.
	x-reset spline cyclic
		-need constant for switch.
	x-set branch radius
		-hierarchy constant for iteration count.
	x-solidified outline

		-removed.
		-compress not working??
	x-tracer
		-for switch.
	--trim curve normalized

reset spline cyclic
-clean up.
	-the performance test show no difference.
		-in multiple Vs. single curve mode.
-very limited room of improvement.

**set curve tilt alignment
-3 modes are chaotic at this moment.
	-can I use menu switch to clarify things better?
-> improved the management, but don't depoly ntl hide inputs available.

set curve tilt alignment
-vector mode as Input as Target option.

Center Falloff
-somehow the advanced panel opened up.

Text Mesh
-Iteration should have a better name.

-Heavy Remesh is down if Extrusion=0
	-fixed.
-**expanded menu for triangles/N-gons...

	-so that showing on the search.

Mix Mesh Normals in Proximity
-support tangent space.
	-not sure the use case but it respond to deformation.

	-add a Density Factor test
		-it was already there.
	-Re-arrange the node to make poisson the last.
--Randomness
	-Abs & Abs Var. Only method may better require a different input subtype?

x--Bevel Curve
	-no inputs can be hidden on different modes.
x-Curve Rolling
	-Stop Mode Vs. Threshold & Clamp?
x-Curve Resampling
	-Resolution Vs. Count mode?
--Proximity Falloff
	-advanced mode should use 3 different float because rel for %, others abs.
		-resetting value is fine since Abs & Abs reverse must not share value.
	-probably no change to the object & Mesh mode.
		-it's easier to keep them exposed without manipulating menu.
x-Noise 3D
	-evolution can have different input?
-Point Instance Geometry
	-by Count or by Custom & advanced Mode?
--**Text Mesh
--Step Extrude
x-Spherical Geo
	-the current design is already ok imo

Set Shade AutoSmooth

	-as in voronoi 3D.

Add: Displace
-position needs to be exposed in case of UV displacement.

Warp Deformer
-renamed: Warp
	-G_ will distinguish my presets and blender nodes anyway.
	-deformer name is stated in menu.
		-or can be used in case blender dev decision or others...
-add a falloff option in addition to the factor?
	-no.
-into a modifier?
	-no. difficult in design. need some texture for fac & falloff?

-Length subtype in meter?

Animate
-Add Warning if End Frame is smaller than Start Frame.
	-should no warning in Duration Mode.
-EndFrame becomes single value due to requirement for active warning.

Motion Variance
-due to start Var. and Clamp Negative, it's only going positive region.
	-> speed variation only, the start variation can be done by delay falloff?
-> currently removing Start Var. and Clamp.
	-perhaps one day to add it...

Proximity Falloff
-If there's no input for any Geo mode, invalid distance 0 will cause falloff 1.
	-fix for falloff 0, and add warning.

Animate
-End Frame will allow field now
	-internally using attribute statistic constant method.

-needs more comment and testing.

Attribute Viewer
-Add decimal Shift to scale

Face Points
--Add Scale Multiplier

	-Scene time will cause re-evaluation of node tree.
-> needs to check cumulative force, join particles, etc.
--Set Particle Parameter
	-is using delta time already.
--cumulative Force
--Resistance Force
-> 4.5 is an important milestone.
	although it's not disastreous in my project yet?
	it's also not frequently used given the current issues.
-> removal of delta time granted withn value precision.
	-currently replaced with 0.03333 in 29.976 cases.
	-full removal will be in 5.0

Random Helices Distribution
-fix randomness

Add: Hair on Curves
-displace the hair on top of curve radius.

-Level default upon ungroup can be improved.

Face Points
-add a warning if no face.

Solidified Outline
-UVMap is greyed out.

-> it's in-use only if Variance for noise is on.

Set Curve Tilt Alignment
-rename: Set Curve Tilt by Normal
-keep the original copy for compatibility.

Set Curve Tilt by Normal
-should expose normal and not to use default attribute

Smooth Curve

	-anyway we don't have swap operator

Random Helices Distribution
-made into modifier.
	-to support single spiral.
-Variance made into a boolean toggle.
	-for better control in case of modifier.

Array on Splines
-why it was outputting curves?
	-the change was made in 2.0, but explanation was not enough.
	-spline index is already an output.
	-normal and tangent won't be good as well because the curve can be quite random?
-> Output points
	-Add spline parameter output.

Random Helices Distribution
	-rename: Random Spirals
-move rot Offset out from panel?
x-be able to sync Start & End Radius?
	-hard to design.
-single values

Add: Random Spirals
-renamed version of random helices distributio.
-if Count=1, enable self object seed.

Array on Splines
-Curve to Points is disrupting sampled result from sample curve node.
	-sampling result should all captured before Curve to Points process?
		-the custom parameter is not captured. but default has captured index.
-> can Sample Curve done outside the node group with Spline Index & Parameter?
	-there's no curve for the sampe curve.

S_Value Precision
-decimal shift & tooltip

Add: Woven Surface

Add: S_Animate

Add: Align Rotation on Curves
-to replace Alignment on Splines

--normlized at count 1 with bug.
--offset loop needs implementation.

Add: Array on Curves
-rename from Array on Splines.

Spline Falloff
-rename: Curve Falloff

Add Deprecation Warning
-at ZF_14

Woven Surface
-output Curves.

Curve Info
-output name changes.
-I notice it's in lower affinity than the built in curve info.
	-but practically they are doing the same so doesn't matter?

Array on Curves
-Normalized Parameter is not within 0-1 range.
	-have to sample it, other methods failed.
	-guess related with capture attribute issue?

Deprecation warning
-remove for the moment.
	-re-enable once the change is affirmative.

**Negati
-Mid-level reverse.
	-in Blender displace modifier. Mid-level 0 means to expand, mid-level 1 means to shrink.
	-it's also more intuitive to say the average is at minimum/maximum.
--Randomness.
--Noise 3D, it's already like this.
--Voronoi 3D, already.

random transform
-output name tool tip Captials.

Curve Deformer
-Investigate: Offset test.
	-some scaling seems wrong?
-> first round pass, it seems ok.
-the cause in snake scale file
		is due to smooth position shrinked extrapola.
	-therefore the start length is altered.

Smooth Position
-for curves, resample evaluated to prevent shrinking on Bezier & Nurbs.

Curve Deformer
-Offset Flow is effected by Mid-Level of Negati.
	-Flow 0 becomes object out, 1 becomes object in.
-> to me it seems un-intuitive.
	-add math to reverse the relationship specific for Curve Deformer.

Hair on Geometry
-Mesh Island Index start with 0. so output disappears for single mesh.
	-use Island Count instead; statistic is still required.

**Face Points
-Join Vertex Points function needs some more thoughts.
	-while it's working on basic case.
	-dynamic case require sampling and capture on respective domain.
		-which is not exposed and has to be done outside.
-> add a geometry input for sampling.
	-add a boolean for "Deformation"?
-cv: if sampling process are included in,
	attribute are still required to be exposed for process?
-> no, in fact if think about those, these issue should be resolved with UV method?
	-how to unwrap and layout UV in designed way?

Bevel Curve
-If curve is dynamically being deleted/created, Length will change.
	-even legnth is stable, UV factor & other will change.
-> need some more general capture.

Curve Deformer
-added a test for instance index for sampling.

Bevel Curve
-profile curve should stay with its static parameter.

Hair on Surface
-it should include random rotation & random scale.
-how this will work with dynamic surface sampling?

Dynamic Surface Sampling
-why is it outputing the newest position?
-shouldn't it output previous position for post-sampling?
	-no, because it will need geometry input and capturing process as well.
-> add some more ways of sampling?
	-regardless, not helping hair on surface...

Hair on Geometry
-in Curve case, need a multiplier on radius
	x-also add decimal shift.
		-node will be big, & as a factor not good?
-> add Radius Offset instead.
	-add decimal estimation so decimal shift can be hidden

Value Precision
-decimal shift accept field for decimal estimation.
	-not need to be done with other nodes yet.

Array on Curves
-Sample Color instead of float. so it can cover more dimensions, etc.

Bevel Curve
-UV by index has mistake.
-Flat mode should not allow any caps.
-Round Caps should have default shade smooth.
-add warning if custom profile fill caps but not cyclic.
	-if no input profile yet, not need to have warning.

Rod
-Fix Caps
-add Decimal Shift

Attribute Spline
-rename: Attribute Curve

Radial Instancer
-rename: Radial Array

Grid Distribution
-rename: Grid Array
-add instance input option.

Radial Array
-Add default points output.

Remap 0-1
-add single decimal shift for outputs.

Tracer
-investigate if it's still working for new generation.
	-can't reproduce any issue, likely due to bad random ID.

Origin Offset
-doesn't work for curve
	-because bounding box was calculated.
-use expanded menu

Follow Splines
-Scale var. default value

Text Mesh
-Extrusion 0 is broken.
	-need to solve both socket visibility issue and clamp min on Extrusion.
-if Extrusion 0, segments should be dimmed to suggest it's not effecting output

Bevel Curve
-profile cyclic warning on fill cap should only be triggered if need to fill cap

Float Range
-why New Float Range is different from old float range in new rope condition.
	-capture and non-capture will cause difference
-> issue in helical connections?
	-a bug in upstream blender. fixed in July.30 5.0
	-but still buggy in 4.5.1; suspecting issue #412202
-> add a capture in Helical Connections for tilt as a downstream fix.
****************************************************************************************************
The Newest Test Demo Tree: ZF_14.
To Do:
Loft Curves
-Attribute captured can't be passed.
	-known issue, because the resultant was actually a different mesh.
	-need panels for sampling...

Add: is New Face
-to detect new faces generated since the operation?
	-for example to help assign material after mesh boolean...

Hair on Geometry
-integrate Hair on Surface into.
	-should also support both Mesh & Curve?

Join Particles
-better non-random particle ID generation system?
	-based on statistics of the largest ID from the group?

Collision in Ray
	--the node is used in shield tutorial; need to think about versioning consequence.
-should switch not depending on attribute existence but implicit vector input.
-position should have some offset towards direction?

Fill Curve Tube
-made into modifier?
	-iteration is on top so not possible?

Array on Curves
-investigate possibility to resample on length?
	-add different modes: Count, Length, Free
-possibility to be a modifier?
	-It's problematic, because so many parameters can be added in between the process of instancing.
	-may need a new node for simple task. what are common workflow? what are needed?

UV Deformer
-option to keep dimension or not.
	-some cases may be better to remap a 2:1 ratio into 1:1 UV map?
-mapping preview sometimes may need validity.

Negati
-support vector.
	-also need to support dif axis?
-> needs to be done after the fix of issues/119923
	-otherwise it will be more difficult to use.

Modulo Falloff
-Support Float & Integer with menu?

Sin Function
-Oscillator using Boolean method?

Field to Constant
-Sample node and statistic node may not differ from performance?
-mean method may be good?
	-differemt modes to change between method?

Add: Offset towards Camera
-needs to be a modifier

Add: Screen on Camera

Add: S_Voronoi Scatter
********************************************************
5.0:
**Remove Trash Code

**Curve Deformer
-Clean up for better design?
	-how was instance mode determined?
	-if Extrapolation can be done in path constraint, why not in deformer?

*Value Precision.
-remove on delta time.

**Decimal Shift
	-some default is currently set to 0 for versioning old files.
-Float Range.
	-1
-Curve Linear
	-1
	-need set curve radius at 0.005?
		-but reason it effect bevel curve because of radius support.
-Bevel Curve
	-1
-Helical Connections
	-1

G_Hash Seed
-a better method can be used, but should only be done in 5.0 because of breaking changes.
	-then it will break with Seed change in 5.0

**Socket Shape Struct
	-it would be better if many nodes' socket structure being re-defined instead of automatic.
	-otherwise confusion between dynamic & single value & field value.

**Node Output Visibility
-Bounding Box Falloff
-Sin Funciton
-Decay Function?
-Reset Local Transform
	-the geometry & field can be separated into each mode.
-Match Size
	-right now the output is in face corner domain.
		-the domain is set by interface and not exposed for changes.
	-> best to have 2 outputs and swapped by conditions.
-Curve Deformer
	-Instance Index should be exposed. it's good for sampling.
	-need to rewrite mode for Single Vs. Instances?
-Bevel Curve
	-should add an "Are Caps" option.
		-but need to hide in flat mode because no fill caps in flat.

**InLine output
-Reset Self Object Transform

-

*Scene Info.
x-improve Animate interpolation?
	-but curves are not accessible?

-Knit
	-may add an vector output for non-center vector?

**Closure and Bundles
-Add loop & noise.
-Instance for each element?
	-save the point node and index input?
	-how to output attribute without store named attribute?
**support curve Interpolate function outside group using Closure & Bundles.

**Interface Order
	-panel used to be only possible at bottom of all.
-Match Size.
	-want to add an custom input option if it's possible.
		-in case of dynamic function that requires a bigger bounding box.

**exposed enum sockets
-??

**Curve & Color Ramp Panel.
	-shouldn't be on most nodes, for the sake of re-usibility.
****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Tree Generator
-Noises displacement is displacing branches out of way.
-need a better interpolation for "over parameter" method.

Add Curve Branch
-this one is broken now due to hierarchy issue?
	-Use different modes for Inside Simulation Vs. Inside Loop.

Animate
-is having a curve scape goat inside for warning evaluation.

Face Points
-Join Vertices Points will cause evaluation disturbance.
	-likely due to sample index disturbance?
-> perhaps better solved by closure to duplicate functions.
	-for now it seems working or not working anyway. pending.
-Dual Mesh doesn't mean the exact vertices location.
	-as avg. point to form polygon for face points can be bad at low subd.
-Join Vertex Points function needs some more thoughts.
	-while it's working on basic case.
	-dynamic case require sampling and capture on respective domain.
		-which is not exposed and has to be done outside.

Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working
	-because they aren't stable relative to geometry?
-basic setup is working.
	-but somehow moving as a whole in complex scene. why?

Tracer
-I think there are cases you don't want to delete trace when they are deleted?

Polygon Unfolding
-has some minor rotation of transform to prevent bug.
	-is it still happening in 4.5???

Solidify
-In Instance Mode, Merge by Distance Not Working.
-not possible to integrate with step extrusion, because output socket visible.

Freeze Geometry
-what if different geometry requiring different status of freeze?
	-switch node can't accept Field.
	-Separate Geometry for Freeze?
		-if the index is changing, what to do?

Set Particle Parameter
-Should Inheret the previous velocity?
	-currently the velocity must be newly written.

Add: Mesh Tangent?
-How to make sure between vertex & face tangent?

Step Extrude
-The stop mode currently doesn't support attribute for multiple polygons.

Bevel Curve
-give warning in Mesh Instances.
	-curve to mesh will work in curve instances wtho realization.
-when used as a modifier for mesh, it will cause lose of material.
	-because of Mesh to Curve step.
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
x-Bend Deform
-Angle Check?
	-didn't check, forgot what's the issue.
	-but so many iteration and changes are being done.
		-this can be closed untl next call.

Bevel Curve
-investigate UV Length Multiplier.
	-seems if field is in scale it will be as if it's determined with statistic?
	-but generally still working.

Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info?

Helical Connections
-is it possible to auto-detect the decimals when connecting in chains?
	-difficult, so far no success.

x-Bevel Curve
-Why Bevel Curve requires additional Set material node?
	-because Mesh to Curve Node will cause lose of materials.

x-Curve Points Preview
-Curve to Points is not working for instances regardless
	-https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/137163

Tracer
-if to use the newly joined geo detection function?
	-[index - (sampled index + 1)]

Unknown Nodes:
-Group Index, Count Per Island.
-Group per Domain
-Iteration Count per Domain.
	-used to be for repeat zone. but currently questionable.
***************************************************************************************************
Still Considering Necessity:
Add: Array Instancer?

Add: Randomize Instance Order?
-Instance on Point + Random Value + Instance Index
-Is this extra nodes really necessary?
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.

Randomness
-Var. means range between full negative Var. & full positive Var.
-Mid-Level Means 2X Positive/Negative.

Check if All index node are using implicit index attribute than ID/Index.
During Instance and Pick Instance
	-Instance Index should use Index instead of ID?
		-should use ID/Index instead.
	-for example if using Is inside View to select point.
		-instance index will glitch, while ID won't.

Named UVMap should Above Vector input UVMap

Advanced= Advanced Settings

tooltips
-use first person for verbs as Blender did.

Decimal Shift:
Shift the decimal point of the above value by powers of 10. Applies division. For example: 2 → divide by 100
