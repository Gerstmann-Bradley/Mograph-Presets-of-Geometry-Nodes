Done:
Loft Curves
-Guide Resampling rename -> Guide Count
-Cross Resampling rename -> Cross Count

**3D Viewer
-use Set GP Color
	-Width tob Radius.
-Fix Default Axis Enum Issue
-slow GP render if too many layers.
	-merge layers also slow.
	-> conversion after instances to keep into single layer.
-Mesh method is a little faster in nodes, but rendering is slower

**Curve to Mesh: now on it's using "Scale".
-the radius no longer effects the thickness.
	-versioning is using the radius to prevent breaking tutorials.
-when to break the old tutorial? how to set it up?
	-> not to break the tutorial; still using the radius.
		-in the future add a use radius option.
-> change from practice, the Scale should now accept a field; multiplied by radius.

Bevel Curve
-Scale now supports field. Radius Compatibility ensured.
-Length Multiplier not working with scale well.
	-because the the Profile Length is a fixed number now.
-UV by Length Can be Removed due to Length Multiplier
	-done
-Improve the Cap UV auto-scaling.
-clean up & add comment.

Add: Mix Normals by Proximity
	-set mesh normal node: pulls/132583

**Is inside View

Knit
-fix

Step Extrusion
-support Step & Stop.

Text Mesh
-update and integrate with Step Extrusion Method

**Expanded Enum Socket.
	-it's an enum but suitable for two item and dyanmic socket visibility.
--Mesh Falloff
	-Expand & Shrink.
--Value Precision
--Grid Distribution
--Bevel Curve
	-Profile
	-Cap Shape
	x-UV by Factor & Index
--Float Range
	-Step Selection can be removed.
		-It was more of a clear way to make sure input in Selection socket.
	-Exclude Ednpoint must not be inlined with previous step selection.
		-will cause confusion of input and output value.
--Curve Linear
	-Step & Stop
	-XYZ
--Animate
	-End & Duration
--3D viewer
	-All, XYZ
--Directional Falloff
	-XYZ

	-axis
x--Smooth Curve
	-too long.
--random Color
--Append Point to Curves
--Bounding Box Fallloff
	-XYZ

--Combine Euler Rotation
--Curve Deformer
	-only completing XYZ now.
	-other mode needs to be considered?
--Step Extrusion
--Rod
--Align Rotation to Point
--Parenting
	-Original Vs. Relative
--Reset Local Transform
	-original Vs.relative.
	-can't deal wth geometry & Vector; since output can't be hidden.

Remove Named Attribute from Curve to Mesh Change
	-replaced with radius node.
	-previously, radius has to be passed for Bevel Curve.
		-but not it's no longer required?
		-keep for versioning, since Bevel Curve is still counting radius.
--Helical Connections
	-yes able to?
	-re-arrange Capture Attribute for both index and radius.
x--Bevel Curves
	-removed one, keep others for now. end result is the same.
x--Curve Extrapolate?
	-if radius doesn't exist, radius node attribute by itself will just be 0.
--Proximity Falloff
	-there is a curve to mesh inside; removable'
--Curve Split
--Sample in Proximity

**New Instance Bounds node
	-at the moment seems broken: issues/138598?
		->not broken, but local needs instance transform.
--Instance Bounding Box.
	-about 2X faster than before.
-Bounding Box Falloff
	-unfortunately no prominent places that can improve the design

**Proximity Falloff Updates
	-right now advanced contains 3 separate Range.
		-although bad for maintainence.
		-but 3 parameters likely will need completely different settings.
x-Mix Normals by Proximity
	-exclude from advanced setting because likely not needed.
--Center Falloff
--Mesh Falloff
--Spline Falloff?

Float Range
-Support Different Domains

Modulo Falloff
-write to replace map range method.
-threshold method improvement
-compare still has to be float to support threshold.

**Expanded Enum Socket
x-Modulo Falloff
	-even splitting to integer & float mode, map range is still float?
--Attribute Viewer
x-Get UVMap
	-enum visibility to switch between modes?
		-Obj Vs. Custom Geometry
	-doesn't simplify anything.
	-if into a modifier, not meaningful to switch enum.
--Index Converge
	-is used in "array on Spline"
		-duplicate element can't be used because its index is serial instead a group.
--Curve Connect
	-not very important?
	-done serial and parallel.
	-but likely needs a complete rewrite and re-design.
		-how to define how many curves in parallel?

**Curve Connect
-rewrite with Points to Curve
	-remember to keep radius

**Expanded Enum Socket
x--Record Velocity
	-made into Menu, but not expand it.

Loft Curves
x-index output?
	-if it's just index value arranged differently. what's the point?

Boolean Toggle of Panel.
x-Loft Curves
	-Advanced Options for Caps.
		-grid subdivsion for caps?
		-how to do that? not even done in Bevel Curve for custom profile.
x-Curve Resampling
	-Points Preview toggle; for radius, use radius?
	-not yet important.

Tracer: removed from known issue
--Dynamic Attribute such as age and falloff will be lost before.
	-This is unavoidable because these attribute are captured upon join.
	->Curve Age is implemented, others requires sample Index.
		-> Implemented.
--If Points are Deleted, tracer will be disrupted.
	->Temporary Sample by ID is implemented.

Float Range
--Stop Mode is not used at 0, but it's still shown as occupied.
	-resolved in new.
-> Removed from known issue.

3D Viewer
-Boolean Toggle for Rotation

attribute Mesh
-split edges are too slow, off by default. and support field.

**Bounding Box is using Radius Now
	-generally not changing anything, but still to remove some in case?
--UV Deformer
	-remove radius
--Bounding Box Falloff
	-remove.
--Mirror Modifier on Mesh

test: ZA_11A
-deleted, it was made before instance attribute is supported
	-so index converge is needed.

mirror modifier
-there's a warning for point cloud due to flip face.
	-disable it since the output won't change.
-for point clouds, flip works, bisect not?
	-build test for is inside volume.

is inside volume
-the direction input shouldn't be normlaized.
	-it can used to calculate length.
-> base multiplier of length by 1000 now.
	so that normalized factor can be 1000 meter.

UV Deformer
-update test & Z-axis factor.
	-don't know why using pi in negati but seems working.

Edge Distance
-rename: Edge Length
	-length is a term used more.

Knit
-change order and default parameters.
	-the reason it uses stop because very difficult for small value?

Curve Split
-can't reove edge parameter.
	-curve segment length value on per point instead of per segment.

hexagonal distribution
-fix curve linear change internally.

Float Range
-Stop Default at 1
-Step should allow negative value now.

Expanded Enum Socket

	-no, but can support menu.
--Is Sharp Angle
	-test again for why is not working for text mesh

Relaxation Solver
-rename: Relaxing Points

**Field Statistic node
--need a new performance test.

	--Branch Gradient
		-used in tree generator
	x-curve deformer
		-dtm cyclic
	x-curve extrapolation
		-dtm cyclic
	--curve rolling
		-used field max to resolve per-spline issue in test 4
	--Dynamic Point Radius
	x-fill curve tube
		-only need to calculate the minimum points.
	x-fill volume
		-remove one and replaced with domain size.
		-keep for capturing purposes. but not sure.	
	x-Get Index
		-keep for now but still need geometry input anyway.
	--Group to Instance
		-different modes include using Bounding Box Center?
			-how to get bounds before split to instance?
	--index converge
		-used in curve connect & array on Splines
		-replaced by domain size.
		-geometry input needed to specific geometry.
			-add domain support by iteration count per domain.
	x-Index List Length
		-it's also important to get a single value.
		-sample index is costy.
	x-index offset
		-feel a bit lost with this design.
		-max is used for group index (ID) for iteration in repeat zone.
	x-is enclosed geometry
		-but what about the value? should be a constant or field?
	--Iteration Count per Domain
		-it's only used in attribute viewer.
		-not requiring sophisticated code.
		-replace statistic wth domain size.
	x-Is Enclosed Geometry
		-slower than attribute statistic
	x-layered proximity falloff
		-not important and useful in the moment.
	x-loft curves
	x-parenting
		-require a constant for transform node.
	x-Point Distribute
		-sum is replicable by accumulate field.
			-same performance as statistic
		-but it still requires a single value.
	x-relaxing Point
		-need a constant for switch.
	x-reset spline cyclic
		-need constant for switch.
	x-set branch radius
		-hierarchy constant for iteration count.
	x-solidified outline
		-switch for menu.
	?-stretch falloff
		-removed.
		-compress not working??
	x-tracer
		-for switch.
	--trim curve normalized

reset spline cyclic
-clean up.
	-the performance test show no difference.
		-in multiple Vs. single curve mode.
-very limited room of improvement.

**set curve tilt alignment
-3 modes are chaotic at this moment.
	-can I use menu switch to clarify things better?
-> improved the management, but don't depoly ntl hide inputs available.

set curve tilt alignment
-vector mode as Input as Target option.

Center Falloff
-somehow the advanced panel opened up.

Text Mesh
-Iteration should have a better name.
-Extrusion depth is different between Fast and Heavy Remesh.
	-because mode 2 & 3 are extruded double sided.
-No Remesh need also step extrusion?
	-done.
-Heavy Remesh is down if Extrusion=0
	-fixed.
-**expanded menu for triangles/N-gons...

Mix Normal by Proximity
-Set Mesh Normal relys on Domain.
	-face domain is better than face corner?
	-seems arguable
-> expose domain.

Mix Normals by Proximity
-rename: Mix Mesh Normals by Proximity.
	-this will show up in the search.

Set Curve Tilt Alignment
-falloff tob tilt falloff
-separate vector in Vector and Surface guide.
-Input as Target made into "Target" object.

Fill Volume
-add Value Precision.

Mix Mesh Normals in Proximity
-fix default 0 normal case.

Proximity Falloff
-clean up, re-arrangem.
-Mesh be renamed to "Geo" since it supports all other types too.
-use points domain in case mixed input that contain no face.
x-a different scale offset for Geo modes.

Point Instance Geometry
-Re-ordering.
-expanded menu to hide sockets.
-panel toggle for pick instance.

Text Mesh
-Fix the dependency issue for dynamic socket visibility.
	-it's not ideal to have .sub group, but I guess no other ways before bundles.
-Fast Remesh.
	-rename: Planar Remesh.
-Heavy Remesh.
	-rename: Voxel Remesh.
-> the name change is basically because the performance cost was not obvious.

Step Extrusion
-rename: Step Extrude
	-so that showing on the search.

Mix Mesh Normals in Proximity
-support tangent space.
	-not sure the use case but it respond to deformation.

Add: Dot Product Falloff
-a modifier version to global position?
	-will be done more personally because it will require a Geo input.
-geometry nodes for now.
-normalization needed.

Float Range
-Step Mode add a decimal shift
	-default 0 for compatibility.

Add: G_Instance Bounds
-make it global, otherwise too pointless to use native local Bounds

Layered Proximity Falloff
-fix Falloff Animation Default Value from 1 to 0.5

Implicit Attribute
-is not an asset, but implicit geometry is?
	-it's mostly supported in node groups already, so no need to be an asset.

Bevel Curve
-Custom Profile into "Free Mode".
	-to hide options that are not effective in Custom Case. 
-Fill Caps into a boolean.
	-Cap Segments default into 1 from now on.
-"Round" renamed to "Circle"

Dynamic Socket Vsibility.
	-technically this is automatic, but require some implementations to use this feature.
x--Point Distribute
	-No, because only Poisson Distance will be hidden by Menu Switch.
	-add a Density Factor test
		-it was already there.
	-Re-arrange the node to make poisson the last.
--Randomness
	-Abs & Abs Var. Only method may better require a different input subtype?
		x-too breaking for my file?
		-the UX will be troublesome due to resetting values?
	-> not worth it?
		-decided to do it.
x--Bevel Curve
	-no inputs can be hidden on different modes.
x-Curve Rolling
	-Stop Mode Vs. Threshold & Clamp?
x-Curve Resampling
	-Resolution Vs. Count mode?
--Proximity Falloff
	-advanced mode should use 3 different float because rel for %, others abs.
		-resetting value is fine since Abs & Abs reverse must not share value.
	-probably no change to the object & Mesh mode.
		-it's easier to keep them exposed without manipulating menu.
x-Noise 3D
	-evolution can have different input?
-Point Instance Geometry
	-by Count or by Custom & advanced Mode?
--**Text Mesh
--Step Extrude
x-Spherical Geo
	-the current design is already ok imo

Set Shade AutoSmooth
-use single value for booleans.

follow path constraint
-needs use resolution.
-use follow Splines method
	-is slower, but for now it's fine.

Noise Texture
-Dimension renamed to Dimensions
	-as in voronoi 3D.

Add: Displace
-position needs to be exposed in case of UV displacement.

Warp Deformer
-renamed: Warp
	-G_ will distinguish my presets and blender nodes anyway.
	-deformer name is stated in menu.
		-or can be used in case blender dev decision or others...
-add a falloff option in addition to the factor?
	-no.
-into a modifier?
	-no. difficult in design. need some texture for fac & falloff?
		-in future design, need nodes to edit falloff & textures?

Random Color

Curve Linear
-Length subtype in meter?

Animate
-Add Warning if End Frame is smaller than Start Frame.
	-should no warning in Duration Mode.
-EndFrame becomes single value due to requirement for active warning.

Motion Variance
-due to start Var. and Clamp Negative, it's only going positive region.
	-> speed variation only, the start variation can be done by delay falloff?
-> currently removing Start Var. and Clamp.
	-perhaps one day to add it...
****************************************************************************************************
The Newest Test Demo Tree: ZF_11.
To Do:

*Scene Info.
x-improve Animate interpolation?
	-but curves are not accessible?
		-closure and bundles?
-Is Inside View Still has resolution X and Y issue.

GN-Known Issue:
Tree Generator
-Noises displacement is displacing branches out of way.
-need a better interpolation for "over parameter" method.

Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working
	-because they aren't stable relative to geometry?
-basic setup is working.
	-but somehow moving as a whole in complex scene. why?

Tracer
-I think there are cases you don't want to delete trace when they are deleted?

Polygon Unfolding
-has some minor rotation of transform to prevent bug.
-

Solidify
-In Instance Mode, Merge by Distance Not Working.
-not possible to integrate with step extrusion, because output socket visible.

S_Vector Seed
-Currently Seed all Positive Value.
	-Too lazy to build the Switch.

Freeze Geometry
-what if different geometry requiring different status of freeze?
	-switch node can't accept Field.
	-Separate Geometry for Freeze?
		-if the index is changing, what to do?

Set Particle Parameter
-Should Inheret the previous velocity?
	-currently the velocity must be newly written.

Add: Mesh Tangent?
-How to make sure between vertex & face tangent?

Step Extrude
-The stop mode currently doesn't support attribute for multiple polygons.

Bevel Curve
-give warning in Mesh Instances.
	-curve to mesh will work in curve instances wtho realization.
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Bend Deform
-Angle Check?

Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Add: Recalculate Normal
-Face normal comparing to Vertex & Edge Normal method?
	-Split edge will offset all local information. all normal to be 0,0,1.
	-flipped face normal leads to flipped vertex normal.

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info?

Bevel Curve
-Why Bevel Curve requires additional Set material node?
	-because of Mesh to Curve Node will cause lose of materials.

Curve Points Preview
-Curve to Points is not working for instances regardless
	-https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/137163

Tracer
-if to use the newly joined geo detection function?
	-[index - (sampled index + 1)]

Unknown Nodes:
-Group Index, Count Per Island.
-Group per Domain
-Iteration Count per Domain.
	-used to be for repeat zone. but currently questionable.
***************************************************************************************************
Still Considering Necessity:
Add: Array Instancer?

Add: Randomize Instance Order?
-Instance on Point + Random Value + Instance Index
-Is this extra nodes really necessary?
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.

Randomness
-Var. means range between full negative Var. & full positive Var.
-Mid-Level Means 2X Positive/Negative.

Check if All index node are using implicit index attribute than ID/Index.
During Instance and Pick Instance
	-Instance Index should use Index instead of ID?
		-should use ID/Index instead.
	-for example if using Is inside View to select point.
		-instance index will glitch, while ID won't.
