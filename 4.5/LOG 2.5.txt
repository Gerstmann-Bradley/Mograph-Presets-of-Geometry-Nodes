Done:
Loft Curves
-Guide Resampling rename -> Guide Count
-Cross Resampling rename -> Cross Count

**3D Viewer
-use Set GP Color
	-Width tob Radius.
-Fix Default Axis Enum Issue
-slow GP render if too many layers.
	-merge layers also slow.
	-> conversion after instances to keep into single layer.
-Mesh method is a little faster in nodes, but rendering is slower

**Curve to Mesh: now on it's using "Scale".
-the radius no longer effects the thickness.
	-versioning is using the radius to prevent breaking tutorials.
-when to break the old tutorial? how to set it up?
	-> not to break the tutorial; still using the radius.
		-in the future add a use radius option.
-> change from practice, the Scale should now accept a field; multiplied by radius.

Bevel Curve
-Scale now supports field. Radius Compatibility ensured.
-Length Multiplier not working with scale well.
	-because the the Profile Length is a fixed number now.
-UV by Length Can be Removed due to Length Multiplier
	-done
-Improve the Cap UV auto-scaling.
-clean up & add comment.

Add: Mix Normals by Proximity
	-set mesh normal node: pulls/132583

**Is inside View
-Update setting
-remove Use Camera Option; by using Instance implicit Geo method.

Knit
-fix

Step Extrusion
-support Step & Stop.

Text Mesh
-update and integrate with Step Extrusion Method

**Expanded Enum Socket.
	-it's an enum but suitable for two item and dyanmic socket visibility.
--Mesh Falloff
	-Expand & Shrink.
--Value Precision
--Grid Distribution
--Bevel Curve
	-Profile
	-Cap Shape
	x-UV by Factor & Index
--Float Range
	-Step Selection can be removed.
		-It was more of a clear way to make sure input in Selection socket.
	-Exclude Ednpoint must not be inlined with previous step selection.
		-will cause confusion of input and output value.
--Curve Linear
	-Step & Stop
	-XYZ
--Animate
	-End & Duration
--3D viewer
	-All, XYZ
--Directional Falloff
	-XYZ
--Radial Falloff
	-Plane Axis
--Attribute Voronoi
--Bend Deformer
	-axis
x--Smooth Curve
	-too long.
--random Color
--Append Point to Curves
--Bounding Box Fallloff
	-XYZ
--Scale Selection
--Combine Euler Rotation
--Curve Deformer
	-only completing XYZ now.
	-other mode needs to be considered?
--Step Extrusion
--Rod
--Align Rotation to Point
--Parenting
	-Original Vs. Relative
--Reset Local Transform
	-original Vs.relative.
	-can't deal wth geometry & Vector; since output can't be hidden.

Remove Named Attribute from Curve to Mesh Change
	-replaced with radius node.
	-previously, radius has to be passed for Bevel Curve.
		-but not it's no longer required?
		-keep for versioning, since Bevel Curve is still counting radius.
--Helical Connections
	-yes able to?
	-re-arrange Capture Attribute for both index and radius.
x--Bevel Curves
	-removed one, keep others for now. end result is the same.
x--Curve Extrapolate?
	-if radius doesn't exist, radius node attribute by itself will just be 0.
--Proximity Falloff
	-there is a curve to mesh inside; removable'
--Curve Split
--Sample in Proximity

**New Instance Bounds node
	-at the moment seems broken: issues/138598?
		->not broken, but local needs instance transform.
--Instance Bounding Box.
	-about 2X faster than before.
-Bounding Box Falloff
	-unfortunately no prominent places that can improve the design

**Proximity Falloff Updates
	-right now advanced contains 3 separate Range.
		-although bad for maintainence.
		-but 3 parameters likely will need completely different settings.
x-Mix Normals by Proximity
	-exclude from advanced setting because likely not needed.
--Center Falloff
--Mesh Falloff
--Spline Falloff?

Float Range
-Support Different Domains

Modulo Falloff
-write to replace map range method.
-threshold method improvement
-compare still has to be float to support threshold.

**Expanded Enum Socket
x-Modulo Falloff
	-even splitting to integer & float mode, map range is still float?
--Attribute Viewer
x-Get UVMap
	-enum visibility to switch between modes?
		-Obj Vs. Custom Geometry
	-doesn't simplify anything.
	-if into a modifier, not meaningful to switch enum.
--Index Converge
	-is used in "array on Spline"
		-duplicate element can't be used because its index is serial instead a group.
--Curve Connect
	-not very important?
	-done serial and parallel.
	-but likely needs a complete rewrite and re-design.
		-how to define how many curves in parallel?

**Curve Connect
-rewrite with Points to Curve
	-remember to keep radius

**Expanded Enum Socket
x--Record Velocity
	-made into Menu, but not expand it.

Loft Curves
x-index output?
	-if it's just index value arranged differently. what's the point?

Boolean Toggle of Panel.
x-Loft Curves
	-Advanced Options for Caps.
		-grid subdivsion for caps?
		-how to do that? not even done in Bevel Curve for custom profile.
x-Curve Resampling
	-Points Preview toggle; for radius, use radius?
	-not yet important.

Tracer: removed from known issue
--Dynamic Attribute such as age and falloff will be lost before.
	-This is unavoidable because these attribute are captured upon join.
	->Curve Age is implemented, others requires sample Index.
		-> Implemented.
--If Points are Deleted, tracer will be disrupted.
	->Temporary Sample by ID is implemented.

Float Range
--Stop Mode is not used at 0, but it's still shown as occupied.
	-resolved in new.
-> Removed from known issue.

3D Viewer
-Boolean Toggle for Rotation

attribute Mesh
-split edges are too slow, off by default. and support field.

**Field Statistic node
--need a new performance test.
	-Mostly faster than attribute statistic
-to replace many statistic which requires geometry input.
	-Get Index
		-but still need geometry input anyway.
	x-Index List Length
		-it's also important to get a single value.
		-sample index is costy.
	x-is enclosed geometry
		-but what about the value? should be a constant or field?
	--Iteration Count per Domain
		-it's only used in attribute viewer.
		-not requiring sophisticated code.
		-replace statistic wth domain size.
	x-Point Distribute
		-sum is replicable by accumulate field.
			-same performance as statistic
		-but it still requires a single value.
	--Branch Gradient
		-used in tree generator
	-Group to Instance
		-different modes include using Bounding Box Center?
			-how to get bounds before split to instance?
	x-Is Enclosed Geometry
		-slower than attribute statistic

**Bounding Box is using Radius Now
	-generally not changing anything, but still to remove some in case?
--UV Deformer
	-remove radius
--Bounding Box Falloff
	-remove.
--Mirror Modifier on Mesh

test: ZA_11A
-deleted, it was made before instance attribute is supported
	-so index converge is needed.

mirror modifier
-there's a warning for point cloud due to flip face.
	-disable it since the output won't change.
-for point clouds, flip works, bisect not?
	-build test for is inside volume.

is inside volume
-the direction input shouldn't be normlaized.
	-it can used to calculate length.
-> base multiplier of length by 1000 now.
	so that normalized factor can be 1000 meter.

UV Deformer
-update test & Z-axis factor.
	-don't know why using pi in negati but seems working.

Edge Distance
-rename: Edge Length
	-length is a term used more.

Knit
-change order and default parameters.
	-the reason it uses stop because very difficult for small value?

Curve Split
-can't reove edge parameter.
	-curve segment length value on per point instead of per segment.

hexagonal distribution
-fix curve linear change internally.

Float Range
-Stop Default at 1
-Step should allow negative value now.

Expanded Enum Socket
--Is Sharp Angle
	-test again for why is not working for text mesh
****************************************************************************************************
The Newest Test Demo Tree: ZF_10.
To Do:
Rewrite Reading Upto..

**Expanded Enum Socket
-Local Offset
	-not very important now, do it later?

Add: Offset towards Camera
-needs to be a modifier

Add: Screen on Camera

**Bounding Box is using Radius Now
	-generally not changing anything, but still to remove some in case?
--UV Deformer
	-remove radius
--Bounding Box Falloff
	-remove.
--Mirror Modifier on Mesh

**Field Statistic node
--need a new performance test.
	-Mostly faster than attribute statistic
-to replace many statistic which requires geometry input.
	-Get Index
		-but still need geometry input anyway.
	-Index List Length
	-is enclosed geometry
		-but what about the value? should be a constant or field?
	-Iteration Count per Domain
	-Point Distribute
	-Branch Gradient
	-Islands instance
	-Group to Instance
	x-Is Enclosed Geometry
		-slower than attribute statistic

Curve Resampling
-into a modifier in case of path constraint?
	-required for speed variation upon moving.
-behavior in case of nurbs path?

Separate Geometry by Index
-rename: separate geometry by ID?

follow path constraint
-needs use resolution.
-use follow Splines method

Add: S_Voronoi Scatter

Temporal Object info
-it's only reading the location, without rotation and scale.
-should get an geometry velocity too?

Mesh Rolling
-what about this method in Curve Rolling?
	-which one to choose, which one should stay?
		-both have to be different, because mesh can't recognize its segment.
-what's wrong with the first few segments?

Curve Deformer
-Flow% is based on % and sometimes causes a delay because of length difference.
	-add an option to normalize the length.
	-also to consider the effect of start length.
********************************************************
4.5:
*Scene Info.
x-improve Animate interpolation?
	-but curves are not accessible?
		-closure and bundles?
-Is Inside View Still has resolution X and Y issue.
----------------------------------
5.0:
Dynamic Socket Vsibility.
x--Point Distribute
	-No, since only Poisson Distance will be hidden by Menu Switch.
	-add a Density Factor test
		-it's in random mode in case for selecting area and screw the distribution?
	-Re-arrange the node.
--Bevel Curve
x--Curve Rolling
	-Stop Mode Vs. Threshold & Clamp?
x--Curve Resampling
	-Resolution Vs. Count mode?
--Proximity Falloff
	-advanced mode should use 3 different float because rel for %, others abs.
	-probably no change to the object & Mesh mode.
x--Noise 3D
	-evolution can have different input?
--Randomness
	-it's already working as expected without updating anything.
-Point Instance Geometry
	-by Count or by Custom & advanced Mode?
--Proximity Falloff
--**Text Mesh
--Step Extrusion
--Text Mesh
x-Spherical Geo
	-the current design is already ok imo

**InLine Socket
-Reselt Self Object Transform
-Curve Extrapolation
x--Time Falloff
	-better to separate the meaning of Time & Falloff
x--Attribute Mesh?
	-has split edge so better to separate the meaning?
-Motion Variance
-Follow Path
-Bevel Curve Fill Cap
-Curve Extrapolation
-reset spline cyclic
-float range
-Snap Function
-Get UVMap
-Join Particles
-Tracer
	-Sample Attribute
-Freeze Geometry

**Inline Socket Need Design.
-Helical Connections
-Fill Volume
-Curve Deformer

**Inline Socket Breaking
-remap 0-1
-Random Rotation
-Curve Extrapolation?
-Store UVMap
-

**Closure and Bundles
-Instance for each element?
	-save the point node and index input?
-support curve Interpolate function outside group?
	-Remap Vector Scale
****************************************************************************************************
GN-Known Issue:
Tree Generator
-Noises displacement is displacing branches out of way.
-need a better interpolation for "over parameter" method.

Hair on Surface
-Proximity targets differently for each point in complex geometry

Dynamic Space Sampling
-Curve Tangent/grid edge tangent method is not working
	-because they aren't stable relative to geometry?
-basic setup is working.
	-but somehow moving as a whole in complex scene. why?

Tracer
-I think there are cases you don't want to delete trace when they are deleted?

Temporal Value
-Not Functioning now because for field it requires geometry.
-Too lazy to fix now.

Polygon Unfolding
-has some minor rotation of transform to prevent bug.
-

Solidify
-In Instance Mode, Merge by Distance Not Working.
-not possible to integrate with step extrusion, because output socket visible.

S_Vector Seed
-Currently Seed all Positive Value.
	-Too lazy to build the Switch.

Freeze Geometry
-what if different geometry requiring different status of freeze?
	-switch node can't accept Field.
	-Separate Geometry for Freeze?
		-if the index is changing, what to do?

Set Particle Parameter
-Should Inheret the previous velocity?
	-currently the velocity must be newly written.

Add: Mesh Tangent?
-How to make sure between vertex & face tangent?

Step Extrusion
-The stop mode currently doesn't support attribute for multiple polygons.
****************************************************************************************************
Investigation:
Bend Deform
-Angle Check?

Reset Instance Origin.
-Use Bounding Box?

Add: Recalculate Normal
-Face normal comparing to Vertex & Edge Normal method?
	-Split edge will offset all local information. all normal to be 0,0,1.
	-flipped face normal leads to flipped vertex normal.

Join Particles
-Investigate: why joining 2/frame has more hits than joining 1/frame?
	-seems to only happen if using temporal object info?

Bevel Curve
-Why Bevel Curve requires additional Set material node?
	-because of Mesh to Curve Node will cause lose of materials.

Curve Points Preview
-Curve to Points is not working for instances regardless
	-https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/137163

Tracer
-if to use the newly joined geo detection function?
	-[index - (sampled index + 1)]
***************************************************************************************************
Still Considering Necessity:
Add: Array Instancer?

Add: Randomize Instance Order?
-Instance on Point + Random Value + Instance Index
-Is this extra nodes really necessary?
****************************************************************************************************
**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.

Randomness
-Var. means range between full negative Var. & full positive Var.
-Mid-Level Means 2X Positive/Negative.

Check if All index node are using implicit index attribute than ID/Index.
During Instance and Pick Instance
	-Instance Index should use Index instead of ID?
		-should use ID/Index instead.
	-for example if using Is inside View to select point.
		-instance index will glitch, while ID won't.
