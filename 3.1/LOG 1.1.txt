Done:
Add: Curve Fill Fracturing
 -for duall mesh fracturing.

Add: Boundary Selection
-Dual Mesh
-Point & Polygon?

Add: Accumulate Float -> Rewrite Float Range Node?
-Step/Stop
-Difference Output -> Step (interval)
Rewrite: Float Range Node
-Used in Curve Linear Node
-Performance Check: Faster, 4.5 Vs. 5.7 ms at 10k Vertices

Add: Count per Island
-Support Both Curve and Mesh Island

Add: Attribute Instance

Add: Offset Field List
-By manipulating Index in Transfer Attribute.
    -Modulo if over?
    -caution about index -1 is index 0. 

Float Range Clean Up
-Curve Linear -seems better performance with new nodes?
Curve Linear optimization possibility.
	-Mesh line + Mesh to Curve.
	-2X slower than curve line because Mesh to curve.

Index List Length
-Kept the same.
	Domain size not good for being in the presets.
	not allowing custom index.

**Add: Implicite Geometry Toggle
	-using Statistic to determine Maximal Index
	-What if Instance? - Realize Instance?
	-If boolean math to check both Point and Instance?
-Bevel Curve Node*
	-Inner "Reset Spline Cyclic" for only bottom one.
-Delay Falloff*
	-Index Control?
	-Add add Randomize Index node, but keep the Geometry Socket for fast use.
-Proximity Falloff
	-decide not to use implicite Geometry, to make clear different modes.
	-Remove Maximal Distance?
	-Reconstruction.

Array on Spline
-Normalized Not Working.
	-Because no Realize Instance.

Shuffle List -> Index Randomize
-Repeat/no mode.

Plain Rotation -> Random Rotation
-Lock on Z axis.

Offset Field List
-check if geometry can be optional?
	decision to remove geometry output in large node tree.
-Test Custom Index for Polygons.
	-Group per domain resolve the problem; not sure about book state.
	-minimal possibility of index manipulation.

Delay Falloff
-Time output in Modulo Mode not working well.
	-Fixed.

**Add: Group Index
-Offset Field List*
-Index Mask Falloff
-Delay Falloff
-Fade Falloff*
	**Confirmed Working for different Domain.
-Reconstruction from Index Converge?
**How to make sure Index Manipulation such as Randomization?

Attribute Spline
-Fix Spline Start & End.
	-If capture attribute, then slowing down processing whether being used or not.
	-So keeping them as transferred attribute.

Alignment on Spline
-Fix Degree & Radians.
	-Vector with Degree sign means these are degree vector instead of vector.
	-fixed by normal vector input.

Bevel Curve
-UV to Length + UV to index.

**Wrap & Modulo
	-Use Wrap to replace all Modulo to aviod issue of negative value?
-Offset Field list*
-Delay Falloff*
	-Doesn't matter because time always goes forward.
	-help clamp the start variation.
-Motion Variance*
-Follow Spline & Array on Spline
	-Use Motion Variance Internally
	-What If I want to Clamp Start/End in Array on Spline?
		-Expand Loop Function instead of using the one provided from Motion variance.

Add: Count per Island
-Count per island not working if points.
	Mesh island isn't always in order.

Delay Falloff
-Default time Input; Custom Time.


Index Converge
-Modification for Value Converge? Undecided.
-Change parameter names.

Follow Spline.
-Change displayed Point Size.

Optimize Bevel Curve Node.
-Option to output UV.

Add: Attribute Voronoi.
-Index, Position, Normal.

Update on Feb.09:

Sin Function
-Linear Mode Fix by adding phase to pingpong pi/2

Add: Filled Circle segment.

Bevel Curve:
-Why Reset Cyclic is not on by default?
	because shade smooth issue. ZA_16a.

1.1.1b
Proximity Falloff
-Add: Animation Offset

Reset Spline Cylic
-Support Instances & multiple splines

Warp
-Change Default value of Factor

Vector noise
-Add Evolution 3D just as Vector wiggle

1.1.2
Fill Volume
-Mid-Level into Slider.

Add: Attribute Island
-position.
-index.
-custom

Solidify
-Mid Level;

Is Inside Volume - No Change.
-What if evaluating points, without normal?
	-grid evaluation must with normal.
	-use custom Direciton
-possibility to be in spline falloff?
	-no, because no value gradation.

Rewrite: Spline Falloff?
-Rewrite
-Fix Reversed order of Min-Max.
-Map range Min be 0, delete "Threashold setting".
-Remove Internal "Trim".
	-seems unnecessary, while trim 100% not helpful for animation offset.
-integrating "Spline Parameter"

Add: Transfer Attribute in Proximity
-Distinguish Float & Vector Attribute? - For now only support Vector Attribute.
	-Design? - the node isn't really huge yet. possible to add Float socket?
	-Performance - Vector Attribute can be tolerated.

Proximity Falloff, Spline falloff
-Fix negative value clamp from animation offset.
	-Double Map range
-Fix +0.01 condition when Size 0.
	-Rather to use Switch than +0.01

Point Distribute
-Optimization
	-Density Method Vs. Face Area method.
-Density Method: Lower Poly, higher accuracy. 2X performance.
1. Cube XYZ-125, Amount-1200.
	Density: 19 ms, Count 1182
	Face Area: 9.4 ms, Count 1158
2. Cube XYZ-2, Amount-1200
	Density: 0.51 ms, Count 1200
	Face Area: 0.64 ms, Count 1030
-Density Method better in General.
	Switch Optimization between Method?
	-Set Switch at 50,000.
-----------------
GN-Todo:

**3.1 New Node and Workflow Changes:
New Compare Node
-Implicite Attribute
	-vector compare not needed anyway.
-Compare Vector

New Map Range Node
-Color Scale (still needed anyway?)
	-where being used?

Scene Time Node
-Time info Node Reconstruction.

Spline Parameter & Spline Length.
-Is Attribute Spline still necessary?
	Yes -Spline index as increment within each Spline.

Face Area Node
-Point Distribute*
	-Find not improving anything. How to use it for distribution?

DELETE:
-Index Converge?
	-ZA_11A
	*Keep it temporarily. In case needs to converge for the future?
	*Why not converge by using transfer in the future?
	-Keep for alternative reason; perhaps remove Geometry Socket?
		-Example: Circular Response.
-Attribute to Instances*
	-ZA_11B
-Color Scale*
	new Map range.
-Float Range*
	-ZA-13
-Geometry To Instance*
-.Loop Step Range & Loop Stop Range*
