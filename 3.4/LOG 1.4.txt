Done:
Add: Random Color HSV.

Follow Spline
Array on Spline
-improvement with new Sample Curve node.

Add: Self Random Value

Add:
-Append Point to Curve

Reset Curve Cyclic
-interpolate domain than capture attribute?
	-Found no Performance improvement.

Add: To Curve Points

Add: Spline Info
-interpolate domain version of attribute Spline

Delete Mix Vector
Delete Helical Connection

Add: Map to UV Space

Bounding Box
-XYZ Default Limit

Transfer Attribute in Proximity
-Renamed to "Sample in Proximity"

Map to UV Space
-Add custom Bounding box.
-Add Mapped Position Output - Deleted, Assumed not useful.
-Add Mapped Normal Output.

Add Curve Split
-Default Selection No?

Directional Falloff
-Default XYZ Limit.

Helical Connection
-Legacy Behavior canceling.

Curve Split
-Capture Radius?

Add: Edge Distance

Map to UV Space
-what if Sample UV map not in the range of 0-1?
	-if using bounding box, tend to cause unwanted point to be eliminated.
-Custom Bound what about Z?
	-I guess Z custom is needed for animation.

**Noise 3D
Vector Noise.
Vector Wiggle - is this node necesssary?
Translate Position.
-Is Object Transform Really necessary?
	-Practically speaking they are barely being used.
-Keep Object Coordinate in the node, but remove sockets.
**What Other Nodes are using Object Coordinate? Total 5 after delete.
	-Noise 3D
	-Vector Noise
	-Translate Position
	-Radial Falloff - Fixed.
	-Voronoi 3D
-Hide .Object Coordinate Now.

Voronoi 3D
-Connect Mid-level to Rounding.
	-Why Rounding Mid-level is reversed?
	-Why Rounding isn't fully accurate?

Map to UV Space
-Vector Map Range rewrite
*****************
To Do:
Index Randomize.
-Group Index?

Proximity Falloff
-Add Absolute scale Offset?

Bevel Curve
-Length UV Check


**Simulation Branch
Start Time, Elapsed Time, Previous Position, Velocity Attribute

**3.4
Transfer Attribute to Sample error?
	-Sample Curve to Points may require Sample by Index£¿

New Node & Workflow Changes:
Trim Curve Support cyclic curve.
Sample Curve node - index.
	*Follow Spline -
		-Performance improvement by 4-7X.
	*Array on Spline -
		-1 curve 1 value from Sample Curve.
		-Mean statistics the fastest method.
Mix Node
-Delete Mix vector
-Delete Mix float
--------------------
GN-Known Issue:
Curve Deform Node.
Center Geometry Node
**Chance of optimization?

Object Coordinate
-Different Order of Operation is required in different cases.
	-wait for Enum List?/Switch?

Bevel Curve
-Is Index UV really needed?
	-deleted

**General rule of Boolean design:
Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
