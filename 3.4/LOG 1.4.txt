Add: Self Random Value

Add:
-Append Point to Curves

Reset Curve Cyclic
-interpolate domain than capture attribute?
	-Found no Performance improvement.

Add: To Curve Points

Add: Spline Info

Delete Mix Vector
Delete Helical Connection

Add: Map to UV Space

Bounding Box
-XYZ Default Limit

Transfer Attribute in Proximity
-Renamed to "Sample in Proximity"

Map to UV Space

-Add Mapped Position Output - Deleted, Assumed not useful.
-Add Mapped Normal Output.

Add Curve Split
-Default Selection No?

Directional Falloff
-Default XYZ Limit.

Helical Connection
-Legacy Behavior canceling.

Curve Split
-Capture Radius?

Add: Edge Distance

Map to UV Space
-what if Sample UV map not in the range of 0-1?
	-if using bounding box, tend to cause unwanted point to be eliminated.
-Custom Bound what about Z?
	-I guess Z custom is needed for animation.

**Noise 3D
Vector Noise.
Vector Wiggle - is this node necesssary?
Translate Position.
-Is Object Transform Really necessary?
	-Practically speaking they are barely being used.
-Keep Object Coordinate in the node, but remove sockets.
**What Other Nodes are using Object Coordinate? Total 5 after delete.
	-Noise 3D
	-Vector Noise
	-Translate Position
	-Radial Falloff - Fixed.
	-Voronoi 3D
-Hide .Object Coordinate Now.

Voronoi 3D
-Connect Mid-level to Rounding.
	-Why Rounding Mid-level is reversed?
	-Why Rounding isn't fully accurate?

Map to UV Space
-Vector Map Range rewrite

Map to UV Space
-Renamed to "UV Deformer"

Center Geometry
-Remove Custom Bound Boolean.
	-use Implicit Geometry.

UV Deformer
-Optimization of Normal Sampling.
	-If no normal input, can we remove it.
	-Capture attribute always computing normal.
	-Sample Attribute better option when not being used.
		-When used in Points, it seems lagging more than capture; otherwise better speed than capturing.

Remap 0-1
-Add Reverse toggle.

Append Points to Curve
-Geometry Renamed to "Curves"
**Curves input and Output consistency
-Bevel Curve
-Append Points to Curve
-Curve Split
-smooth curve
-merge distance curve

Fix ZB_07 Attribute Voronoi
-Missing "Mix Vector"

Append Point to Curves
-Set point is effecting all points
	-index not excluded because of selection input.
	-Interpolate Domain is needed.

Point Distribute
-Amount, lower minimum 0 clamp

Array on Splines
-renamed to "Array on Splines"
-Index Not propagating.
	-Modulo function on curve domain size to recover Spline Index.
-Issue of Duplicating Element in Spline Index
	-Index Converge than Modulo Method.

Index Converge
-Add Moudlo function.

Follow Splines
Array on Splines
-Parameter & Offset/10

Follow Splines
-Node too BIG
	-Remove Motion Variance Group
	-Remove Normalize
	-Keep Scale Variance.
-Parameter -> "Offset/10"
Array on Splines
-Offset -> "Offset/10"

Curve Extrapolate
-Complete Rewrite
	-Simplify
	-only tangent and offset needed.
-Support Curves than Single Curve
	-tutorial of interpolate domain?

Add: To Bounding Box

Attribute Voronoi
-Optimize by Sample Index than Capturing
	-Data Changed due to Split Edges.
	-how to keep data use sample index?

Curve Deform
-Complete Rewrite
-Repeated Vector rotate.
	-chance of optimization? - Finished.
Curve Extrapolate
-Automatic Flipping?
	-Seems not needed. Implemented but disabled.

Add: Instance Bounding Box

Add: 3D Viewer

Curve Deformer
-Support Instances
	-I don't want to capture instance attribute twice.
	-I don't want to output Instance Index in Instance Bounding Box.
		-Since they are irrelevant.
	-Mesh island may not correspond to Instance Index.
	-Mesh island as default, Instance index as Custom.

Curve Deformer
-Scaling
-Rotation change
	-Seems not necessarily better result.
Curve Extrapolate
-Dynamic Extension?
	-I dont' want to use complicate switch, what if flow is field. Extrapolation can't be field?

Curve Deformer
-At Instance mode, Curve length not shared across different curve.
	-Sample Instance Index on Spline length of spline domain.

Curve Deformer
-condition for Instances following a single Curve.
	-Add Test; Possibly need to loop Curve Index.
*****************
To Do:
Index Randomize.
-Group Index?

Proximity Falloff
-Add Absolute scale Offset?

Bevel Curve
-Length UV Check

**Simulation Branch
Start Time, Elapsed Time, Previous Position, Velocity Attribute

Curve Raycast Collision Detection
Branching Thickness Decrement

Dynamic Orientation

Follow Spline

**3.5
Add: Expand Selection Node
	-can it be used to shrink?

**3.4
Transfer Attribute to Sample error?
	-Sample Curve to Points may require Sample by Index£¿
Transfer Attribute in Proximity
-Renamed to "Sample in Proximity"

New Node & Workflow Changes:
Trim Curve Support cyclic curve.
Sample Curve node - index.
	*Follow Spline -
		-Performance improvement by 4-7X.
	*Array on Spline -
		-1 curve 1 value from Sample Curve.
		-Mean statistics the fastest method.
Mix Node
-Delete Mix vector
-Delete Mix float
--------------------
GN-Known Issue:
Multi Switch needed
-Curve Deform
-Directional Falloff
-Radial Falloff
-Group Per Domain

Object Coordinate
-Different Order of Operation is required in different cases.
	-wait for Enum List?/Switch?

Bevel Curve
-Is Index UV really needed?
	-deleted

Solidify
-Merge by Distance is merging other points too.
	-no way to resolve it.

**General rule of Boolean design:
Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
