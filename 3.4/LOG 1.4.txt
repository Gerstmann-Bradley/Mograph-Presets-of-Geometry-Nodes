Add: 3D Viewer

Curve Deformer
-Support Instances
	-I don't want to capture instance attribute twice.
	-I don't want to output Instance Index in Instance Bounding Box.
		-Since they are irrelevant.
	-Mesh island may not correspond to Instance Index.
	-Mesh island as default, Instance index as Custom.

Curve Deformer
-Scaling
-Rotation change
	-Seems not necessarily better result.
Curve Extrapolate
-Dynamic Extension?
	-I don't want to use complicate switch, and what if flow is field. Extrapolation can't be field for every curve?

Curve Deformer
-At Instance mode, Curve length not shared across different curve.
	-Sample Instance Index on Spline length of spline domain.
-condition for Instances following a single Curve.
	-Add Test; Possibly need to loop Curve Index.

	-Output Distance offset in Extrapolate.
	-Input Distance offset.
-Why Clamp Is not working?
	-negati is giving midlevel 0.5. lower than the threshold
	-I don't know if Clamp is really needed. I Also don't know if a Fix is needed.
	-Delete Geometry When it's outout clamp
		-Bypass Delete if Cyclic Spline

Translate Position
-Missing Implicit Attribute.

3D Viewer
-Add Rotation
-Change Marker for Matrix Pointing.

Add: Face Rotation
	-Naming
	-In Blender, Lower the weight, higher the priority
		-Should we follow the same principle in making the preset?

		-Multiply -1 better than 1/divide.
		-Should apply to all weight input. I am going against blender's implementation.
	-Should Offset index be included?
Add: Edges of Face
-Interpolate domain to replace field at index.

	-but not working for spiral.
	-made a new method included in "Spiral Unfold", but not sure if should be merged into Curve Connect. How to design for different mode of merging?

3D viewer
-Add Axis Option.

Curve Points Preview
-Add Show Curve Option.

	-Add a domain.

3D Viewer
-Curve Count bug

Spiral Unfold
-Rotation Guide, & Add Rotation

Curve Deform
-Flow offset based on Scale.
	-Scaling is occured at center point as expected.

	-The initial implementation was made for "Factor".

Random Transform
-Broken due to missing vector wiggle.
	-fixed but didn't test out.
		-Tested; Mid-level 0
-Freq Add 0.001 to avoid perlin pitfall.

Add: Face Dimension

Add: Face Points
-Mesh to Points Method Vs. Dual Mesh method

	-note Name similarity with Remap Vector by Bounds

Custom Weights Vs. Weights Vs. Custom Cost
	-Face Dimension
	-Edges of face
	-Face Points
-blender is using lighter weight.
-preset is custom weights is for heavier weight - Multiply -1.

Remap Vector by Bounds
-Renamed to "Remap Vector to Bounds"?
	-Name similarity to "Remap Vector Bounds"
Remap Vector Bounds
-"Normalize Vector Bounds"

Add: Vertex Rotation

Face Points
-Why it has to Split Edge?
	-Edges of Vertex may go beyond its polygon
	-> Add: Weighting Edge Option to choose between Split Edge Vs. non-Split Edge method
-Performance test.
	-100*100 UV Sphere
	-2.4 ms Vs. 23 ms.
-Weight Test
	-is interpolate domain needed?
-The necessity of Sample Index
	-Mesh to Points is losing Geometry Data.
	-Consistent Capturing not necessarily a good idea?
	-Sampling is better performant than Capturing.

Edges of Face
-Add: Weighing Edges.
	-NOT Possible. Split Edge is needed for Polygon Animaiton.

Boundary Selection
-Investigate - Voronoi Splitting.
	-If the mesh contain holes, the Dual Mesh Edge won't be accurate.

Vertex Rotation
-Normal Only Rotation
-Aligning to an Edge isn't a good solution.

Face Points
-Normal Only Rotation
	-pivot Z alignment on X + pivot Auto alignment on Z.

Alignment on Splines
-Bypass rotate euler.

Array on Spline
-Sample Index onto Points cost the most performance.
	-Rotation requires 2 attribute thus 2X performance.

	-2X faster performance benefit.
-Instance Vs. Duplicate Element
	Duplicate Element 2X slower than Instance

Curve Linear
-Improve Performance of Stop Mode.
	-2X faster in non-centered Stop Mode
	-2X faster in Centered Stop Mode.

Add: Hair on Surface
-not to include point distribute inside.
	-Or else will add >=4 sockets.

	-Not N-mode, "And" Weighing Edge, instead of "Or"

Add: Is Sharp Edge

Curve Linear
-Fix Orientation bug in the Stop Mode.

UV Deformer
-Z axis remap factor 0.5.
-Add Curve radius 0 in bounding box for temporary support of 3.5 bug.

**Bevel Curve

-Internal Split Edge with Face Set Boudnary; saving performance than universal split.
-Add Toggle for Split Edges.

Duplicate Geometry
-Rename: "Point Instance Geometry"

Points Distribute
-when the face area extremely small. default density 10 will result in 0 points creation.
-bump up density will cause minimal performance cost in small mesh.
	-change 10 -> 50. in a huge mesh 80X80X80 cube it seems 5X slow.

Boundary Selection
-Rewrite using "Edge neighbor = 1" method
	-not perfect in Point Domain. requires Edge Domain.

Bevel Curve
-Reset Spline Cyclic when cyclic
	-shouldn't this feature implemented in reset spline cyclic instead?
-reverse to again implement UV to Index mode.
	-Fac/Length may change when curve is deformed.
	-but Index will not unless resampled.
*****************
To Do:
Index Randomize.
-Group Index? -Failed

Proximity Falloff
-Add Absolute scale Offset?

-Directional Falloff
-Radial Falloff
-Group Per Domain
-Follow Splines
-Array on Splines
-Remap Vector by Bounds
-3D Viewer

Curve Deformer
-What if I need special settings in special cases?
	-no Extrapolation
	-no extra clamping.
-worth to add more options and more switches?

Object Coordinate
-Different Order of Operation is required in different cases.
	-wait for Enum List?/Switch?

Bevel Curve
-Is Index UV really needed?
	-deleted
	-reverse deletion
	-Fac/Length may change upon curve deformation, but index will not.

UV Deformer
-Not to use "normal" at curve.
	-Z-evaluation is triggered by "Curve Bounding Box" bug.

Solidify
-Merge by Distance is merging other points too.
	-no way to resolve it.

**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.
