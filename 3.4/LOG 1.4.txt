Map to UV Space
-what if Sample UV map not in the range of 0-1?
	-if using bounding box, tend to cause unwanted point to be eliminated.
-Custom Bound what about Z?
	-I guess Z custom is needed for animation.

**Noise 3D
Vector Noise.
Vector Wiggle - is this node necesssary?
Translate Position.
-Is Object Transform Really necessary?
	-Practically speaking they are barely being used.
-Keep Object Coordinate in the node, but remove sockets.
**What Other Nodes are using Object Coordinate? Total 5 after delete.
	-Noise 3D
	-Vector Noise
	-Translate Position
	-Radial Falloff - Fixed.
	-Voronoi 3D
-Hide .Object Coordinate Now.

Voronoi 3D

-Vector Map Range rewrite

Map to UV Space
-Renamed to "UV Deformer"

Center Geometry
-Remove Custom Bound Boolean.
	-use Implicit Geometry.

UV Deformer
-Optimization of Normal Sampling.
	-If no normal input, can we remove it.
	-Capture attribute always computing normal.
	-Sample Attribute better option when not being used.
		-When used in Points, it seems lagging more than capture; otherwise better speed than capturing.

Remap 0-1
-Add Reverse toggle.

Append Points to Curve
-Geometry Renamed to "Curves"
**Curves input and Output consistency
-Bevel Curve
-Append Points to Curve
-Curve Split
-smooth curve
-merge distance curve

Fix ZB_07 Attribute Voronoi
-Missing "Mix Vector"

Append Point to Curves
-Set point is effecting all points
	-index not excluded because of selection input.
	-Interpolate Domain is needed.

Point Distribute
-Amount, lower minimum 0 clamp

Array on Splines
-renamed to "Array on Splines"
-Index Not propagating.
	-Modulo function on curve domain size to recover Spline Index.

	-Index Converge than Modulo Method.

Index Converge
-Add Moudlo function.

Follow Splines
Array on Splines
-Parameter & Offset/10

Follow Splines
-Node too BIG
	-Remove Motion Variance Group
	-Remove Normalize
	-Keep Scale Variance.
-Parameter -> "Offset/10"
Array on Splines

Curve Extrapolate
-Complete Rewrite
	-Simplify
	-only tangent and offset needed.
-Support Curves than Single Curve
	-tutorial of interpolate domain?

Add: To Bounding Box

Attribute Voronoi
-Optimize by Sample Index than Capturing
	-Data Changed due to Split Edges.
	-how to keep data use sample index?

Curve Deform
-Complete Rewrite
-Repeated Vector rotate.
	-chance of optimization? - Finished.
Curve Extrapolate
-Automatic Flipping?
	-Seems not needed. Implemented but disabled.

Add: Instance Bounding Box

Add: 3D Viewer

Curve Deformer
-Support Instances
	-I don't want to capture instance attribute twice.
	-I don't want to output Instance Index in Instance Bounding Box.
		-Since they are irrelevant.
	-Mesh island may not correspond to Instance Index.
	-Mesh island as default, Instance index as Custom.

Curve Deformer
-Scaling
-Rotation change
	-Seems not necessarily better result.
Curve Extrapolate
-Dynamic Extension?
	-I don't want to use complicate switch, and what if flow is field. Extrapolation can't be field for every curve?

Curve Deformer
-At Instance mode, Curve length not shared across different curve.
	-Sample Instance Index on Spline length of spline domain.
-condition for Instances following a single Curve.
	-Add Test; Possibly need to loop Curve Index.
-Easier and more intuitive Value Generation Method
	-Captureing Multiple Parameters May Cost performance.
		-Test shown Instance Bounding Box cost the most performance than capturing other parameters.

Curve Deformer
-What if Cyclic Curve
-Bug Some Instances Not Shown.
	-Instance Bounding Box Bug? Some Values output 0.
		-Mesh Island Default doesn't work for Suzanne. Single Instance contains 3 island.
	-Instance Overlapped. 2 instance on a single curve.
		-Modulo was wrong to have subtract 1.
-Do we preview curves?

3D Viewer
-Delete Overlaping Points
	-Performance Test, Merge by Distance much more expansive than instancing 100000 Instances.

Duplicate Geometry
-Improvement using Points.

Curve Extrapolate
-Add Factor control on Start and End.
Curve Deformer
-Add Controls of Extrapolates
-Must we include Extrapolate Inside?
		-If changing Extrapolate, it will change factor offset.
		-What if multiple curves of different Spline Length
	-Output Distance offset in Extrapolate.
	-Input Distance offset.
-Why Clamp Is not working?
	-negati is giving midlevel 0.5. lower than the threshold
	-I don't know if Clamp is really needed. I Also don't know if a Fix is needed.
	-Delete Geometry When it's outout clamp
		-Bypass Delete if Cyclic Spline

3D viewer
-Default Attribute to take Position.
-If Width=1, no Bevel

UV Deformer not working on UV from Curves
-why?
	-Needs Double Reset Spline Cyclic
Bevel Curve
-Double Reset Spline Cyclic
-Double Fac/Length.

Translate Position
-Missing Implicit Attribute.

3D Viewer
-Add Rotation
-Change Marker for Matrix Pointing.

Add: Face Rotation
	-Naming
	-In Blender, Lower the weight, higher the priority
		-Should we follow the same principle in making the preset?
		-why is it so unintuitive?
		-Multiply -1 better than 1/divide.
		-Should apply to all weight input. I am going against blender's implementation.
	-Should Offset index be included?
Add: Edges of Face
-Interpolate domain to replace field at index.
-Reduce amount of interpolate domain

Curve Split
-Can points being connected after split?
	-no, what if multiple points on a single spline are deleted.

Add: Curl Noise Turbulence
-Copied from Entagma tutorial.
-Already outputing -1 to 1 range.
	-Divide 2 for +/-0.5 range.
	-Currently no Mid-Level.

Noise 3D
-Optimize Fac Output
-Add Falloff Option
-Should I rearrange the Sockets?
	-Decide Not.
	-Note Upon Rearrangement, there will be no compatibility issue.

Add: Curve Connect
-For Unfolding spiral reasons.
*****************
To Do:
Index Randomize.
-Group Index?

Proximity Falloff
-Add Absolute scale Offset?

UV Deformer
-Try to Check &/ Fix some height issue.

**Simulation Branch
Start Time, Elapsed Time, Previous Position, Velocity Attribute

Curve Raycast Collision Detection
Branching Thickness Decrement

Dynamic Orientation

Follow Spline

Add: Trigger
-Boolean Trigger
-Time recording.

**3.5
Add: Expand Selection Node
	-can it be used to shrink?

**3.4
Transfer Attribute to Sample error?
	-Sample Curve to Points may require Sample by Index£¿
Transfer Attribute in Proximity
-Renamed to "Sample in Proximity"

New Node & Workflow Changes:
Trim Curve Support cyclic curve.
Sample Curve node - index.
	*Follow Spline -
		-Performance improvement by 4-7X.
	*Array on Spline -
		-1 curve 1 value from Sample Curve.
		-Mean statistics the fastest method.
Mix Node
-Delete Mix vector
-Delete Mix float
--------------------
GN-Known Issue:
Multi Switch needed
-Curve Deform
-Directional Falloff
-Radial Falloff
-Group Per Domain
-Follow Splines
-Array on Splines

Curve Deformer
-What if I need special settings in special cases?
	-no Extrapolation
	-no extra clamping.
-worth to add more options and more switches?

Object Coordinate
-Different Order of Operation is required in different cases.
	-wait for Enum List?/Switch?

Bevel Curve
-Is Index UV really needed?
	-deleted

Solidify
-Merge by Distance is merging other points too.
	-no way to resolve it.

**General rule of design:
Boolean Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
Statistic Mean is of the best performance.
