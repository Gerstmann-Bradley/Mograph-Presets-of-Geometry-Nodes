Done:
Add: Random Color HSV.

Follow Spline
Array on Spline
-improvement with new Sample Curve node.

Add: Self Random Value

Add:
-Append Point to Curve

Reset Curve Cyclic
-interpolate domain than capture attribute?
	-Found no Performance improvement.

Add: To Curve Points

Add: Spline Info
-interpolate domain version of attribute Spline

Delete Mix Vector
Delete Helical Connection

Add: Map to UV Space

Bounding Box
-XYZ Default Limit

Transfer Attribute in Proximity
-Renamed to "Sample in Proximity"

Map to UV Space
--Add custom Bounding box.
*****************
To Do:
Index Randomize.
-Group Index?

Proximity Falloff
-Add Absolute scale Offset?

**Simulation Branch
Start Time, Elapsed Time, Previous Position, Velocity Attribute

**3.4
Transfer Attribute to Sample error?
	-Sample Curve to Points may require Sample by Index.

New Node & Workflow Changes:
Trim Curve Support cyclic curve.
Sample Curve node - index.
	*Follow Spline -
		-Performance improvement by 4-7X.
	*Array on Spline -
		-1 curve 1 value from Sample Curve.
		-Mean statistics the fastest method.
Mix Node
-Delete Mix vector
--------------------
GN-Known Issue:
Curve Deform Node.
Center Geometry Node
**Chance of optimization?

Object Coordinate
-Different Order of Operation is required in different cases.
	-wait for Enum List?/Switch?

Bevel Curve
-Is Index UV really needed?

**General rule of Boolean design:
Yes/No - Check=yes, uncheck=no.
